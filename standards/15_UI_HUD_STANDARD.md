# {{PROJECT_NAME}} UI HUD Standard

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines the {{PROJECT_NAME}} desktop HUD requirements. {{PROJECT_NAME}} adapts the {{UI_REFERENCE}} orbital HUD as the canonical desktop UI reference while preserving {{PROJECT_NAME}} daemon ownership of protocol, state, policy, and tools.

The target is product and interaction parity, not source-code parity.

## 2. Architecture

The HUD is a client of `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d`.

Rules:

- The daemon owns durable state and operational state.
- The HUD may keep ephemeral render state.
- The HUD must not execute tools.
- The HUD must not approve actions locally.
- The HUD and code work panel must not spawn shells, run tests, apply
  patches, or remove worker worktrees directly.
- The HUD must not treat browser local storage as authoritative.
- All config writes must route through daemon protocol.
- All agent, model, approval, and voice state must be derived from daemon responses and events.

## 3. Required Shell

The main HUD shell must include:

- custom window chrome
- status bar
- orbital HUD
- approval stack overlay
- chat panel
- unified config dialog
- agent rename dialog

Component names should follow {{PROJECT_NAME}} naming:

```text
{{PROJECT_NAME}}WindowChrome
{{PROJECT_NAME}}StatusBar
{{PROJECT_NAME}}OrbitalHud
{{PROJECT_NAME}}ApprovalStack
{{PROJECT_NAME}}ChatPanel
{{PROJECT_NAME}}ConfigDialog
{{PROJECT_NAME}}AgentRenameDialog
```

## 4. Window Requirements

Desktop behavior:

- transparent frameless window
- preferred size around 1600x1000
- minimum size around 1200x760
- custom drag chrome
- configure button
- always-on-top toggle
- minimize
- close
- background opacity preference

Linux is the initial HUD target. macOS has source-validation coverage only, and
Windows HUD runtime support is blocked on transport, shell, path, sandbox, and
audio adapters. See `docs/28_PLATFORM_BASELINE.md`. Toolkit selection may be
Tauri + React for fastest parity or a Rust-first toolkit if it preserves the
interaction contract.

## 5. Orbital HUD

The orbital HUD must use a 16:9 logical layout based on 1920x1080.

Required elements:

- central {{PROJECT_NAME}} orb
- two faint orbital rings
- dashed spokes from orb to agents
- 12 non-overlapping perimeter slots
- agent satellite cards
- nested worker tree under each agent, derived from daemon `agent.session.*` and
  `worker.*` events
- model, context, mode, and voice readouts around the orb
- state-driven orb animation

Allowed orb states:

```text
idle
listening
thinking
speaking
working
waiting
```

## 5.1 {{AVATAR_NAME}} Avatar Engine

The default center avatar remains the {{PROJECT_NAME}} orb. {{AVATAR_NAME}} is an optional avatar
style and must follow `docs/26_AVATAR_ENGINE.md`.

Rules:

- {{AVATAR_NAME}} avatar selection must be daemon-backed through `hud.avatar_style`.
- The current Three.js {{AVATAR_NAME}} Arc implementation is a HUD prototype and migration
  reference, not the long-term native engine boundary.
- `crates/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-avatar` owns the renderer-independent state engine and exposes
  `AvatarFrame`, `BodyGestureState`, `AvatarPrivacy`, fallback state, and
  direct-wgpu uniform contract data without depending on `wgpu` or Bevy.
- The preferred native renderer is a focused Rust/wgpu engine. The renderer
  adapter should consume `WgpuAvatarUniforms` and `WgpuRendererContract`
  directly once the heavy renderer dependency is introduced.
- Bevy remains optional and deferred behind the future `bevy-renderer` feature
  unless {{PROJECT_NAME}} accepts a broader 3D scene engine.
- {{AVATAR_NAME}} must render from daemon-derived HUD state and disposable renderer state;
  it must not own sessions, agents, models, tools, policy, approvals, voice, or
  memory.
- {{AVATAR_NAME}} must provide scripted body gestures for idle, listening, thinking,
  speaking, coding, approval, and error states.
- Body gestures must carry priority metadata so safety and approval states can
  interrupt decorative animation.
- Reduced-motion mode must disable large body gestures and preserve readable
  state with minimal color, opacity, or mouth/reticle changes.
- Renderer failure must fall back to the {{PROJECT_NAME}} orb without blocking the HUD.

Optional face tracking:

- off by default
- explicit permission required before camera access
- local-only processing
- visible camera-active indicator
- no persisted frames, landmarks, embeddings, or biometric templates
- graceful fallback to scripted gestures when unavailable or denied

## 6. Status Bar

The status bar must show:

- current main agent display name
- daemon connection state
- selected main model
- active agent count
- waiting agent count
- idle agent count
- optional latency
- optional system stats later

Disconnected state must reference the {{PROJECT_NAME}} daemon, not {{LEGACY_UI}}.

## 7. Chat Panel

The chat and voice panel must include:

- streaming chat log
- user, assistant, and system messages
- composer textarea
- Enter to send
- Shift+Enter for newline
- quick action chips
- voice status
- mic button
- voice settings button
- model settings button

The send action must use `message.send`. Sending must be disabled when disconnected unless an explicit offline queue is implemented.

## 8. Approval Stack

Approval cards must show:

- risk class or rule
- agent
- action or command
- cwd or workspace
- reason
- risk summary
- expiry, when available
- approve and deny buttons

Button clicks must send `approval.respond`. Cards must remain visible until `approval.resolved` arrives from the daemon.

## 9. Config Dialog

{{PROJECT_NAME}} must use one unified config dialog with these tabs:

- Voice
- Models
- Appearance
- Window

The selected tab may be UI-local session state. Saved preferences must go through `ui.preferences.set` or a more specific daemon request.

## 10. Agent Rename

Rename opens from:

- right-click or context action on the central orb for the main agent
- right-click or context action on an agent card for subagents

Rules:

- trim whitespace
- collapse repeated whitespace
- cap at 32 characters
- blank main-agent name falls back to `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`
- blank subagent name falls back to role default
- submit through `agent.rename`
- persist in daemon state
- update surfaces from `agent.renamed`

## 11. Theme and Appearance

The HUD must support six themes:

| Key | Label |
| --- | --- |
| `arc` | ARC REACTOR |
| `amber` | AMBER |
| `phosphor` | PHOSPHOR |
| `violet` | VIOLET |
| `alert` | ALERT |
| `ice` | ICE |

Themes must be hue-driven OKLCH token sets. Theme and opacity changes must update live and persist through daemon config.

## 12. Accessibility and Responsiveness

Requirements:

- icon buttons have accessible labels
- theme swatches have labels or tooltips
- sliders show visible values
- dialogs close through backdrop and explicit close button
- text must not overflow cards
- long model names must compact gracefully
- central orb display name must resize dynamically
- no overlapping UI at 1200x760, 1600x1000, or 1920x1080

## 13. Protocol Requirements

The HUD must use {{PROJECT_NAME}} protocol requests and events:

Requests:

```text
message.send
agent.rename
agent.model.set
models.list
approval.respond
ui.preferences.get
ui.preferences.set
voice.preview
voice.stop
worker.tail
worker.result
worker.cleanup
window.preference.set
```

Events:

```text
daemon.status
models.list.response
agent.status.changed
agent.task.changed
agent.renamed
message.delta
message.completed
approval.requested
approval.resolved
worker.started
worker.log.delta
worker.completed
worker.failed
worker.cancelled
worker.cleanup.requested
patch.created
test.result
orchestrator.route
ui.preferences.updated
voice.preview.started
voice.preview.completed
voice.preview.failed
```

## 14. Code Work Artifact View

The P14 code work panel is a protocol client and a read-only review surface.
The merged baseline opens from the worker tree and renders worker status,
summary, worktree/artifact references, test-report metadata, and recent daemon
log tail.

Rules:

- Render worker status, worktree state, and artifact metadata from daemon
  `worker.*`, `patch.created`, and `test.result` events.
- Show inline `summary.md`, `patch.diff`, `changed-files.json`,
  `test-report.json`, and bounded terminal log previews only through
  daemon-sanctioned read-only projections. The current HUD baseline shows
  artifact references and log tail; rich inline artifact content remains future
  work.
- Do not read arbitrary local filesystem paths from the renderer.
- Do not execute `shell.run`, run tests, edit files, apply patches, or delete
  worktrees from the UI process.
- Apply actions, when enabled, must route to approval-gated `file.patch` or a
  future patch-apply tool owned by `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d`.
- Discard or cleanup actions, when enabled, must route to a separate approved
  cleanup flow that verifies {{PROJECT_NAME}}-owned worker/worktree metadata.

## 15. Open-Source Cleanup

Before public release:

- replace {{UI_REFERENCE}} brand text with {{PROJECT_NAME}} where used in implementation
- replace {{LEGACY_UI}} wording with {{PROJECT_NAME}} daemon wording
- remove private source paths from user-facing docs
- confirm asset licensing
- recreate icons as {{PROJECT_NAME}} assets when needed
- verify no provider keys or local config values are committed

## 16. Testing Requirements

Required HUD tests:

- theme helper tests
- agent name normalization tests
- agent rename protocol test
- voice prefs serialization tests
- config dialog render test
- approval card waits for resolved event
- reconnect and backoff test
- protocol event mapping tests
- code work artifact view reducer/render tests
- screenshot parity at 1600x1000
- screenshot parity at 1920x1080
- minimum size check at 1200x760
- no {{LEGACY_UI}} text or path remains in UI
