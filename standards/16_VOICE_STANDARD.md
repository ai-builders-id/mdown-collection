# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Voice Standard

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines {{PROJECT_NAME}} voice behavior for text-to-speech, voice preferences, previews, HUD state, and safe content routing. Voice is an optional feature and must not become a dependency for core daemon, CLI, tool, or policy operation.

## 2. Ownership

Voice preferences are durable daemon-owned configuration.

The HUD may keep ephemeral preview state, but it must use daemon requests for durable changes and voice actions unless a later architecture decision explicitly makes preview HUD-owned.

## 3. Provider Contract

{{PROJECT_NAME}} must define a TTS provider trait before adding production voice engines.

Provider responsibilities:

- synthesize short speakable text
- report supported voices
- apply rate, pitch, and volume preferences
- support stop or cancellation where possible
- return structured errors
- avoid logging sensitive text unnecessarily

Initial provider options:

- `edge`
- `elevenlabs`
- `openai`
- `system`
- `stub`

The `stub` provider is required for deterministic tests.
Provider credentials must remain in environment variables or local secret files,
never protocol payloads or committed config. Stubs must report provider identity,
curated voices, and lifecycle success or structured failure without making
external API calls, spawning compatibility helpers, or reading provider
credentials.

## 4. Voice Preferences

Voice preferences belong in `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/config.toml`.

Required fields:

```text
enabled
provider
voice_id
rate
pitch
volume
auto_speak
max_spoken_chars
```

Recommended ranges:

```text
rate       -50..50, step 5
pitch      -50..50, step 5
volume     -50..50, step 5
```

Default voice:

```text
id-ID-GadisNeural
```

Provider defaults may be exposed for convenience, but `voice_id` is always
user-configurable provider data. Runtime routing must use the selected
`provider`; it must not infer ElevenLabs or any other provider from one
hard-coded voice ID.

## 5. Curated Voice Catalog

Initial curated voices:

| ID | Label | Locale | Gender |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| provider default | ElevenLabs Default | id-ID | Neutral |
| `id-ID-ArdiNeural` | Ardi (Indonesian, Male) | id-ID | Male |
| `id-ID-GadisNeural` | Gadis (Indonesian, Female) | id-ID | Female |
| `ms-MY-OsmanNeural` | Osman (Malay, Male) | ms-MY | Male |
| `ms-MY-YasminNeural` | Yasmin (Malay, Female) | ms-MY | Female |
| `en-US-AvaNeural` | Ava (US, Female) | en-US | Female |
| `en-US-AndrewNeural` | Andrew (US, Male) | en-US | Male |
| `en-US-EmmaNeural` | Emma (US, Female) | en-US | Female |
| `en-US-BrianNeural` | Brian (US, Male) | en-US | Male |
| `en-GB-SoniaNeural` | Sonia (GB, Female) | en-GB | Female |
| `en-GB-RyanNeural` | Ryan (GB, Male) | en-GB | Male |

The catalog should remain curated and small for the HUD. Advanced provider voice discovery may be added separately.

## 6. Speakable Content Policy

{{PROJECT_NAME}} must speak only content that is useful and safe to hear.

| Content Kind | Speak |
| --- | --- |
| chat | yes if short and auto-speak is enabled |
| summary | yes |
| approval | risk summary only |
| error | short actionable error |
| code | no |
| diff | no |
| terminal_log | no |
| test_result | short summary only |

Long answers must be summarized before speaking. Long code, diffs, logs, and raw command output must not be spoken.

The daemon speech policy must run before provider dispatch. Policy rejection
must prevent `voice.started`, `voice.completed`, provider calls, and logging of
the blocked text body.

## 7. Auto-Speak Rules

Auto-speak must:

- wait for final assistant output
- respect `enabled`
- respect `auto_speak`
- respect `max_spoken_chars`
- skip code, diff, and terminal logs
- stop current speech before starting a new preview or explicit speech action

Streaming deltas must not be spoken one by one.

In the current daemon-owned slice, long content that requires summarization is
blocked from direct speech until a summarization path exists.

## 8. Approval Speech

Approval speech is allowed only as a concise risk summary.

It may include:

- action category
- agent display name
- workspace
- risk class
- short reason

It must not read long commands, secrets, diffs, or full logs aloud.

## 9. HUD Voice UI

The HUD voice UI must include:

- voice state machine: idle, listening, thinking, speaking
- voice selector
- rate slider
- pitch slider
- volume slider
- auto-speak toggle
- engine label
- test voice button
- stop test button
- error message
- last engine success hint
- microphone debug capture with permission, device, stream, recorder, analyser RMS/peak, and silence reason

Voice preview should use the main agent display name in the sample text.

## 10. HUD STT Capture

The HUD may capture microphone audio locally for STT, but it remains a protocol client. It must not move durable voice ownership, policy, or core agent routing out of `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d`.

Tauri/WebKitGTK builds must explicitly enable WebKit media streams before handling microphone permission requests. The Linux HUD setup must call WebKit settings `enable-media-stream` for the main webview and then allow audio-only `UserMediaPermissionRequest` requests. Video capture must not be allowed by this path.

The renderer STT path must expose deterministic microphone diagnosis:

- microphone permission state when available
- visible audio input count and selected input label
- media stream active/inactive state
- track enabled, muted, ready state, channel count, and sample rate when provided by WebKit
- `MediaRecorder` state and MIME type for transcription capture
- WebAudio PCM capture source, frame count, and byte count for WebKit builds
  where `MediaRecorder` opens a track but produces zero chunks
- analyser state, sample rate, RMS, peak, and frame count
- silence reason, including no signal, muted track, suspended audio context, below voice threshold, trailing silence, or max duration

The HUD visualizer must be driven from actual analyser time-domain samples. It must not show synthetic movement that can hide a silent or disconnected input.

If `MediaRecorder` produces no encoded chunks but the analyser and WebAudio PCM
path receive samples, the HUD must send the PCM fallback to STT instead of
dropping the utterance. A moving visualizer with `chunks=0` therefore indicates
an encoder fallback path, not a failed microphone.

## 11. Protocol

Voice requests:

```text
voice.status
voice.doctor
voice.preflight
voice.preview
voice.stop
ui.preferences.set
```

Voice events:

```text
voice.status.updated
voice.doctor.response
voice.preflight.response
voice.preview.started
voice.preview.completed
voice.preview.failed
ui.preferences.updated
```

Voice preview failure must be visible in the HUD and structured in logs.
The HUD must report its local bridge doctor/preflight results to `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d`
through `voice.preflight`, while still keeping microphone capture, WebAudio PCM
fallback, whisper invocation, and native playback local to the HUD/Tauri bridge.

## 12. Privacy and Logging

Voice logs must not store unnecessary spoken text.

Rules:

- Do not log provider credentials.
- Do not log full text for code, diffs, logs, or secret-bearing content.
- Redact before persistence.
- Prefer metadata such as content kind, character count, provider, voice ID, and outcome.

Microphone debug output should stay renderer-local unless the user explicitly runs a diagnostic command. Device IDs must be shortened or omitted in UI/debug output; labels, counts, states, RMS/peak, and failure reasons are sufficient for normal diagnosis.

## 13. Testing Requirements

Required tests:

- voice preference serialization
- default voice selection
- curated catalog shape
- speakable content routing
- long answer summarization trigger
- code, diff, and log suppression
- approval risk summary routing
- preview started/completed/failed events
- stop behavior
- HUD control state mapping
- HUD microphone debug state mapping
- visualizer sample mapping from analyser input
