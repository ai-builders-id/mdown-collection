# UI State and Protocol Contract

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the daemon-backed state contract required to adapt the {{UI_REFERENCE}} HUD into {{PROJECT_NAME}} without making the UI the owner of core state.

## 2. Core Rule

The HUD may cache state for rendering, but `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` owns durable state and all authoritative operational state.

The UI must never execute tools, approve actions locally, mutate agent runtime
state directly, apply worker patches, delete worktrees, or treat local browser
storage as the source of truth. The HUD and code work panel are protocol clients
of `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d`, not execution surfaces.

## 3. View Model

The HUD may keep this ephemeral view model:

```text
HudViewState
|-- connection
|-- active_config_tab
|-- chat_draft
|-- local_scroll_positions
|-- selected_agent_id
|-- rename_dialog_target
|-- pending_local_voice_preview
`-- event_derived_snapshot
```

`event_derived_snapshot` is rebuilt from daemon events and snapshots.

## 4. Durable Preferences

Durable preferences belong in daemon config/state:

```toml
[hud]
theme = "arc"
avatar_style = "orb"
background_opacity = 82
hotkey = "Super+Space"
always_on_top = false

[hud.chat]
thinking = false
fast = true

[voice]
enabled = false
provider = "edge"
voice_id = "id-ID-GadisNeural"
rate = 0
pitch = 0
volume = 0
auto_speak = true
max_spoken_chars = 800

[agents.display_names]
main = "{{PROJECT_NAME}}"
coder = "Codex"

[agents.models]
main = "openai/gpt-5.5"
coder = "openai/gpt-5.5"
```

## 5. Requests

### `events.subscribe`

Sent when the HUD establishes a daemon connection that should receive runtime
events without polling.

```json
{
  "type": "events.subscribe",
  "since_event_id": "evt_000120",
  "replay_limit": 128,
  "include_snapshot": true
}
```

The daemon responds with `request.accepted`, then sends snapshot events, bounded
replay, and live events on the same connection. HUD should rebuild
`event_derived_snapshot` from those events and keep the last seen `event_id` for
reconnect.

In the Tauri HUD, the renderer remains a protocol client and does not open the
Unix socket directly. It calls the native `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}_events_subscribe` command with
the same protocol request envelope. The native side keeps the socket open,
reads newline-delimited `ServerFrame` JSON from `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d`, and emits each frame
to the renderer as a `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-frame` Tauri event. If the socket closes
unexpectedly, native emits `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-subscription-closed`; the renderer marks the
gateway disconnected and reconnects with bounded backoff using the last seen
`event_id` as `since_event_id`.

The HUD may still use `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}_request` for one-shot commands such as
`models.list`, `daemon.status`, `message.send`, and preference or approval
requests. Authoritative state changes must arrive through daemon events before
the UI treats them as applied.

### `events.snapshot`

Sent when the HUD needs a one-shot daemon-owned state snapshot.

```json
{
  "type": "events.snapshot"
}
```

The current desktop MVP snapshot is encoded as event frames, including
`agent.list.response`, `ui.preferences.updated`, and `session.updated`.

### `session.subscribe`

Sent when a client wants only one session's events rather than the daemon-wide
event stream.

```json
{
  "type": "session.subscribe",
  "session_id": "ses_...",
  "replay_limit": 128,
  "include_snapshot": true
}
```

The daemon responds with `request.accepted`, then sends the current
`session.updated` event, bounded replay, and live events whose envelope
`session_id` matches the request. The HUD may use this for focused session panes
while keeping daemon-wide `events.subscribe` as the main state feed.

### `worker.tail`, `worker.result`, and `worker.cleanup`

Sent when a worker tree or code work panel needs daemon-owned worker details.
`worker.tail` replays bounded daemon log lines. `worker.result` returns compact
terminal worker and linked AgentSession events without raw log replay.
`worker.cleanup` records cleanup intent for a terminal {{PROJECT_NAME}}-owned worker
worktree; it does not delete files.

```json
{
  "type": "worker.result",
  "worker_id": "worker_000001"
}
```

The UI must treat all three as daemon requests. It must not read arbitrary
artifact paths directly, spawn commands, or remove worktree files locally.

### `message.send`

Sent when the user submits text in the chat panel.

```json
{
  "type": "message.send",
  "session_id": null,
  "target_agent_id": "codex",
  "content": "@codex fix the auth bug",
  "content_kind": "chat"
}
```

`target_agent_id` is optional. HUD may include it as a hint when a leading
`@agent` mention resolves locally, but `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` remains authoritative and emits
`orchestrator.route` for the final route.

### `agent.rename`

Sent after the rename dialog submits.

```json
{
  "type": "agent.rename",
  "agent_id": "main",
  "display_name": "{{PROJECT_NAME}}"
}
```

Rules:

- daemon normalizes or validates again
- daemon persists accepted name
- daemon emits `agent.renamed`
- UI updates from event

### `agent.model.set`

Sent when a per-agent model selector changes.

```json
{
  "type": "agent.model.set",
  "agent_id": "coder",
  "model": "ollama/qwen2.5-coder"
}
```

### `agent.specialist.set`

Sent when an agent settings dialog changes the specialist persona.

```json
{
  "type": "agent.specialist.set",
  "agent_id": "atlas",
  "specialist_id": "marketing",
  "specialist_label": "Marketing",
  "persona": "Act as a senior growth marketer. Translate goals into positioning, audience insights, campaigns, funnels, messaging, and measurable experiments."
}
```

Rules:

- daemon persists accepted specialist profile on the agent
- daemon includes the persona in future prompts routed to that agent
- daemon applies the built-in Humanizer skill before responses so normal chat
  stays natural, concise, and in the user's language
- daemon emits `agent.specialist.changed`
- UI updates from event

### `models.list`

Sent by HUD on connect or config dialog open.

```json
{
  "type": "models.list"
}
```

### `approval.respond`

Sent when user clicks approve or deny.

```json
{
  "type": "approval.respond",
  "approval_id": "apr_123",
  "verdict": "approve"
}
```

The UI must not remove the card immediately.

### `ui.preferences.set`

Sent when the user changes theme, opacity, chat prefs, window prefs, or other HUD preferences.

```json
{
  "type": "ui.preferences.set",
  "patch": {
    "hud": {
      "theme": "ice",
      "avatar_style": "{{AVATAR_SLUG}}_arc",
      "background_opacity": 75
    }
  }
}
```

### `voice.preview`

Sent when user clicks voice test.

```json
{
  "type": "voice.preview",
  "text": "Halo, saya {{PROJECT_NAME}}. Audio test berhasil.",
  "prefs": {
    "voice_id": "id-ID-GadisNeural",
    "rate": 0,
    "pitch": 0,
    "volume": 0
  }
}
```

### `voice.stop`

Sent when user clicks stop during preview or speech.

```json
{
  "type": "voice.stop"
}
```

### `voice.status`, `voice.doctor`, and `voice.preflight`

Sent by the HUD to read daemon-visible voice state and to publish local bridge
preflight results. The HUD still owns platform capture/playback mechanics; it
does not become authoritative for durable voice preferences, speech policy, or
agent routing.

```json
{
  "type": "voice.preflight",
  "surface": "{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud",
  "summary": "ready",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "microphone",
      "status": "ok",
      "message": "1 input visible"
    },
    {
      "name": "MediaRecorder",
      "status": "warn",
      "message": "recorder available; WebAudio PCM fallback remains armed"
    }
  ]
}
```

The local bridge preflight must include microphone permission/API state,
`MediaRecorder`, analyser, WebAudio PCM fallback, whisper binary/model,
Node helper, and audio player checks when available.

## 6. Events

### `daemon.status`

Drives connection and status bar.

```json
{
  "type": "daemon.status",
  "state": "connected",
  "latency_ms": 3,
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

### `session.started`

Creates a visible session progress row before model output arrives.

```json
{
  "type": "session.started",
  "session_id": "ses_123",
  "title": "Fix auth test"
}
```

### `agent.list.response`

Replaces the seeded roster with daemon-owned agent state.

```json
{
  "type": "agent.list.response",
  "agents": [
    {
      "agent_id": "codex",
      "role": "Coding",
      "display_name": "Codex",
      "parent_agent_id": null,
      "model": "codex-cli/chatgpt-plan",
      "status": "idle",
      "specialist_id": "engineering",
      "specialist_label": "Engineering",
      "persona": "Act as a senior software engineer. Focus on implementation quality, tests, maintainability, and concrete code-level tradeoffs."
    }
  ]
}
```

### `agent.spawned`

Adds a newly created agent or subagent to the HUD roster.

```json
{
  "type": "agent.spawned",
  "agent_id": "coding_1",
  "role": "Coding",
  "display_name": "Builder",
  "parent_agent_id": "main",
  "model": "codex-cli/chatgpt-plan",
  "status": "idle"
}
```

### `models.list.response`

Updates model catalog and default model.

```json
{
  "type": "models.list.response",
  "models": ["openai/gpt-5.5", "ollama/qwen2.5-coder"],
  "default_model": "openai/gpt-5.5",
  "agent_models": {
    "main": "openai/gpt-5.5",
    "coder": "ollama/qwen2.5-coder"
  }
}
```

### `agent.status.changed`

Drives agent card status dot and counts.

```json
{
  "type": "agent.status.changed",
  "agent_id": "coder",
  "status": "working"
}
```

Allowed UI statuses:

```text
working
idle
waiting
spawning
completed
failed
cancelled
```

The optional `task` field on `agent.status.changed` drives the current task
summary. A separate `agent.task.changed` event is reserved for a later protocol
version.

### `agent.session.started` / `agent.session.updated` / terminal events

Tracks daemon-owned per-route agent runtime state. HUD may display these as
task details under the agent card, but it must treat `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` as authoritative
for timeout, budget, cancellation, result, and parent-child metadata.

```json
{
  "type": "agent.session.started",
  "agent_session_id": "ags_000001",
  "session_id": "ses_123",
  "route_id": "route_000001",
  "agent_id": "coder",
  "parent_agent_id": "main",
  "task": "run focused tests",
  "status": "running",
  "timeout_at": "2026-04-26T00:15:00Z",
  "budget_steps": 1,
  "steps_used": 0
}
```

Terminal events are `agent.session.completed`, `agent.session.failed`, and
`agent.session.cancelled`. Status values are `started`, `running`, `completed`,
`failed`, `cancelled`, `timed_out`, and `budget_exceeded`.

When a client sends `session.cancel`, `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` marks active AgentSessions as
`cancelled` and active model-provider callbacks return provider-boundary
`Cancel` at the next stream callback. HUD should keep rendering the
`agent.session.cancelled` state and must not convert a later closed stream into
an error unless a distinct `session.failed` event is received.

### `agent.renamed`

Confirms rename and updates all surfaces.

```json
{
  "type": "agent.renamed",
  "agent_id": "main",
  "display_name": "{{PROJECT_NAME}}"
}
```

### `agent.specialist.changed`

Confirms specialist/persona changes and updates all agent surfaces.

```json
{
  "type": "agent.specialist.changed",
  "agent_id": "atlas",
  "specialist_id": "marketing",
  "specialist_label": "Marketing",
  "persona": "Act as a senior growth marketer. Translate goals into positioning, audience insights, campaigns, funnels, messaging, and measurable experiments."
}
```

### `message.delta`

Streams assistant text.

```json
{
  "type": "message.delta",
  "session_id": "ses_123",
  "delta": "I found the failing test",
  "content_kind": "chat",
  "agent_id": "main",
  "agent_name": "{{PROJECT_NAME}}"
}
```

### `message.completed`

Marks final assistant output.

```json
{
  "type": "message.completed",
  "session_id": "ses_123",
  "content_kind": "summary",
  "content": "I found the failing test and opened the code window.",
  "agent_id": "main",
  "agent_name": "{{PROJECT_NAME}}"
}
```

### `approval.requested`

Creates approval card.

```json
{
  "type": "approval.requested",
  "approval_id": "apr_123",
  "risk_class": "git-force-push",
  "agent_id": "coder",
  "title": "Approval needed",
  "reason": "Force push to protected branch",
  "command": "git push --force origin main",
  "workspace": "/home/user/Project/app",
  "expires_at": "2026-04-26T12:05:00Z"
}
```

### `approval.resolved`

Removes or updates approval card.

```json
{
  "type": "approval.resolved",
  "approval_id": "apr_123",
  "verdict": "deny",
  "resolved_by": "telegram"
}
```

### `worker.started` / `worker.log.delta` / `worker.completed` / `worker.failed` / `worker.cancelled`

Updates worker tree and optional transient worker card.

```json
{
  "type": "worker.started",
  "worker_id": "worker_auth_01",
  "agent_id": "coding_1",
  "parent_agent_id": "coder",
  "status": "running",
  "cli": "{{PROJECT_SLUG}}",
  "cwd": "/home/user/Project/app",
  "summary": "running cargo test",
  "worktree": {
    "workspace_id": "app",
    "project_root": "/home/user/Project/app",
    "worktree_root": "/home/user/Project/app/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/worktrees",
    "worktree_path": "/home/user/Project/app/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/worktrees/worker_auth_01",
    "branch_name": "{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/worker_auth_01/fix-auth",
    "base_ref": "HEAD",
    "state": "active",
    "cleanup_policy": "explicit"
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "root": "/home/user/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/default/artifacts/workers/worker_auth_01",
    "patch": "/home/user/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/default/artifacts/workers/worker_auth_01/patch.diff",
    "test_report": "/home/user/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/default/artifacts/workers/worker_auth_01/test-report.json",
    "summary": "/home/user/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/default/artifacts/workers/worker_auth_01/summary.md",
    "changed_files": "/home/user/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/default/artifacts/workers/worker_auth_01/changed-files.json",
    "memory_candidates": "/home/user/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/default/artifacts/workers/worker_auth_01/memory-candidates.jsonl"
  }
}
```

`worker.log.delta` carries `worker_id`, `delta`, and optional `agent_id` /
`parent_agent_id`. Terminal worker events carry the same metadata plus optional
`summary`; `worker.failed` may include `error_code` and redacted `error`, while
`worker.cancelled` may include `cancellation_requested_at`. `worker.tail` returns
recent daemon-owned log lines as `worker.log.delta` events for an existing
worker; clients should apply those events through the same worker reducer used
for live updates. `worker.result` returns compact terminal worker and linked
AgentSession result events without replaying raw logs, so it is suitable for
read-only code work review. `worker.cleanup` records cleanup intent for a
terminal {{PROJECT_NAME}}-owned worker worktree and emits `worker.cleanup.requested`;
it does not delete files. Terminal worktree states such as `review_pending` and
`cleanup_pending` are planning states; they do not authorize patch application
or deletion by the UI.

HUD worker progress is derived from daemon events only. The worker tree may
combine `agent.session.*` progress (`steps_used` / `budget_steps`) with
`worker.*` status, log tail, worktree metadata, and artifact paths, but it must
not create, execute, cancel, or approve workers locally.

The P14 HUD code work panel uses the same rule. The merged baseline is a
read-only artifact view over daemon worker events, bounded log summaries, and
daemon-provided or profile-scoped artifact references. It renders worker
summary/status, worktree/artifact paths, test-report metadata, and recent
daemon log tail without reading arbitrary files from the renderer. Rich inline
artifact previews for `summary.md`, `patch.diff`, `changed-files.json`,
`test-report.json`, and `memory-candidates.jsonl` remain future daemon
read-only projections. The panel must not run commands, invoke `shell.run`
directly from the renderer, edit files, apply patches, or remove worker
worktrees. Current apply/discard controls are disabled placeholders; when
enabled, they must send daemon requests and wait for approval-gated results.

### `orchestrator.route`

Adds route transparency row.

```json
{
  "type": "orchestrator.route",
  "id": "route_123",
  "source": "hud-chat",
  "target_agent_id": "coder",
  "target_agent_name": "Codex",
  "reason": "@coder prefix"
}
```

### `ui.preferences.updated`

Confirms settings persisted by daemon.

```json
{
  "type": "ui.preferences.updated",
  "preferences": {
    "hud": {
      "theme": "arc",
      "avatar_style": "orb",
      "background_opacity": 82
    }
  }
}
```

### `voice.preview.started`, `voice.preview.completed`, `voice.preview.failed`

Drive voice test UI.

```json
{
  "type": "voice.preview.completed"
}
```

`voice.preview.started` and `voice.preview.completed` currently carry empty
payloads. Provider and voice selection remain visible through
`voice.status.updated`.

### `voice.status.updated`, `voice.doctor.response`, `voice.preflight.response`

Drive the voice status and doctor rows in the HUD config dialog.

```json
{
  "type": "voice.status.updated",
  "enabled": false,
  "state": "disabled",
  "provider": "edge",
  "voice_id": "id-ID-GadisNeural",
  "stt_language": "auto",
  "max_spoken_chars": 800,
  "bridge": "hud-local"
}
```

`voice.doctor.response` and `voice.preflight.response` wrap the same status with
`checks[]`, each containing `name`, `status`, and `message`. The HUD maps
daemon `ok`, `warn`, and `error` statuses to its existing pass/warn/fail doctor
presentation.

Daemon-visible TTS provider IDs are `edge`, `elevenlabs`, `openai`, and
`system`; `stub` is reserved for deterministic tests. `voice_id` is
provider-specific user configuration, so HUD state must preserve custom IDs and
route TTS by the selected provider instead of matching one fixed voice ID.

## 7. {{UI_REFERENCE}} Topic Mapping

| {{UI_REFERENCE}} topic/message | {{PROJECT_NAME}} request/event |
| --- | --- |
| `user.message` | `message.send` |
| `agent.model` | `agent.model.set` |
| `agent.rename` | `agent.rename` |
| `approval.respond` | `approval.respond` |
| `models.list` | `models.list` |
| `models.list.response` | `models.list.response` |
| `agent.*.status` | `agent.status.changed` |
| `agent.*.task` | `agent.task.changed` |
| `session.*.message` | `message.delta` / `message.completed` |
| `worker.*.event` | `worker.started` / `worker.log.delta` / `worker.completed` / `worker.failed` / `worker.cancelled` / `worker.cleanup.requested` |
| `approval.requested` | `approval.requested` |
| `approval.resolved` | `approval.resolved` |
| `orchestrator.route` | `orchestrator.route` |

## 8. Connection Behavior

HUD connection behavior should preserve {{UI_REFERENCE}}'s operational feel:

- connect to local daemon only
- perform protocol handshake
- send `events.subscribe` with the last seen event ID when available
- request model list after handshake
- reconnect with exponential backoff
- keep last subscription set
- never log tokens

{{PROJECT_NAME}} replacement discovery:

```text
1. explicit socketPath argument passed to the Tauri {{PROJECT_SLUG}}_request command
2. {{PROJECT_NAME}}_HUD_SOCKET
3. {{PROJECT_NAME}}_SOCKET
4. socket_path in ~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/config.toml
5. $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d.sock when XDG_RUNTIME_DIR exists
6. ~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/run/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d.sock
7. Future {{PROJECT_NAME}}_HUD_URL or hud-gateway.port if WebSocket mode is enabled
```

`VITE_{{PROJECT_NAME}}_SOCKET_PATH` may seed browser-preview development state, but it is
not an authoritative runtime configuration source.

## 9. Voice Routing Policy

The HUD must speak only speakable content:

| Content kind | Speak |
| --- | --- |
| chat | yes if short and auto-speak enabled |
| summary | yes |
| approval | risk summary only |
| error | short actionable error |
| code | no |
| diff | no |
| terminal_log | no |
| test_result | short summary only |

`{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` applies this policy before provider dispatch. Auto-speak waits for the
final `message.completed` event and may then emit `voice.started` and
`voice.completed` for short speakable content. Code, diffs, terminal logs, and
long raw tool or test output must not emit voice playback events.

## 10. Validation

Protocol adaptation is valid when:

- HUD can render from a mock {{PROJECT_NAME}} event stream.
- HUD shows `session.started`, `orchestrator.route`,
  `agent.status.changed`, and `message.delta` progress before
  `message.completed`.
- HUD worker progress renders from the mock daemon worker stream fixture without
  a running agent runtime.
- All {{UI_REFERENCE}} UI features have {{PROJECT_NAME}} request/event equivalents.
- UI preferences persist through daemon config, not localStorage.
- Approval card lifecycle is server-confirmed.
- Code work artifact views are read-only and route apply/cleanup back through
  daemon approvals.
- Rename and model selection survive HUD restart.
- Disconnection and reconnect behavior are visible and tested.
- `apps/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud` passes pnpm lint, typecheck, unit tests, frontend build, and
  `src-tauri` cargo check in CI.
