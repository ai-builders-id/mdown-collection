# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Standards Index

## Purpose

This folder defines the standards required to run {{PROJECT_NAME}} like a serious large open-source project.

These standards are mandatory for contributors and AI agents unless a maintainer-approved decision record says otherwise.

## Priority Tiers

### Tier 0: Must Exist Before Runtime Implementation

- contribution
- code
- architecture
- security
- testing
- protocol
- tool runtime
- approval policy
- license/dependency
- CI/CD

### Tier 1: Must Exist Before Public Pre-Alpha

- documentation
- release
- governance
- config/persistence
- observability
- model provider

### Tier 2: Must Exist Before Desktop Alpha

- agent
- UI/HUD
- voice
- performance

## External Best-Practice Baseline

{{PROJECT_NAME}} standards are informed by:

- OpenSSF Best Practices Badge and OpenSSF Scorecard for security posture and repository health.
- SLSA for supply-chain integrity and release provenance.
- Rust API Guidelines for Rust public API quality.
- Semantic Versioning for version behavior after public APIs are declared.
- Keep a Changelog for human-readable changelog structure.
- Conventional Commits for structured commit messages.
- GitHub community health guidance for contributor-facing project files.

## {{PROJECT_NAME}}-Specific Baseline

The external baseline is adapted to {{PROJECT_NAME}} constraints:

- `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` is the authority.
- UI, Telegram, voice, Android, and CLI are clients.
- Tools must go through policy.
- Approvals fail closed.
- Logs are JSONL and redacted.
- Runtime state is local-first.
- Model providers are replaceable.
- {{UI_REFERENCE}} is the canonical HUD reference.
- Code-heavy work is visual, not spoken.
- Linux is the primary runtime/HUD target; macOS and Windows validation status
  is defined in `docs/28_PLATFORM_BASELINE.md`.

## How To Use This Folder

When a task touches a standard area:

1. Read the relevant standard first.
2. Read the corresponding product/technical docs.
3. Make the change.
4. Update checklist and docs if behavior changes.
5. Run the relevant validation.
