# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Model Provider Standard

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines the contract for model providers in {{PROJECT_NAME}}. Providers supply model output, but they do not own sessions, policy, tools, approvals, persistence, or UI state.

## 2. Provider Boundary

The daemon calls model providers through a common `ModelProvider` abstraction.

Provider implementations are responsible for:

- request translation
- streaming response handling
- provider error mapping
- capability metadata
- authentication lookup
- cancellation support where available

Provider implementations must not:

- execute tools directly
- approve actions
- persist raw secrets in event logs
- mutate daemon state outside provider result APIs
- require UI-specific logic

## 3. Initial Providers

{{PROJECT_NAME}} should support these providers according to the implementation plan:

| Provider | Priority |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI | P1 |
| Ollama | P1 |
| Anthropic | P2 |
| Gemini | P2 |
| OpenRouter | P2 |
| Custom HTTP | P2 |

One provider is sufficient to prove the first streaming path, but the abstraction must not hard-code one vendor.

## 4. Capability Metadata

Each provider and model must expose capability metadata.

Recommended fields:

- provider ID
- model ID
- display name
- streaming support
- tool-call support
- JSON/schema support
- vision support, if applicable
- context window, if known
- local or remote execution
- cost metadata, if configured
- rate-limit hints, if known

The HUD and CLI may display capability data, but the daemon remains authoritative.

## 5. Configuration

Provider config belongs in `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/config.toml` with environment variable overrides where appropriate.

Rules:

- Do not store raw provider keys in event logs.
- Prefer environment variables for secrets.
- Config parsing must produce actionable errors.
- Missing optional providers must not prevent daemon startup.
- `{{PROJECT_SLUG}} doctor` should report provider readiness without exposing secrets.

## 6. Streaming Contract

Providers must emit normalized model events:

```text
model.started
model.delta
model.completed
model.failed
model.cancelled
```

The daemon maps provider events into {{PROJECT_NAME}} session events such as `message.delta` and `message.completed`.

Streaming rules:

- Preserve token order.
- Providers must emit normalized events through the shared callback interface.
  Providers that do not support native upstream streaming must use the same
  callback interface to emit structured simulated deltas from chunked output.
- The callback returns `ModelStreamControl::Continue` to accept more events or
  `ModelStreamControl::Cancel` to request provider-boundary cancellation.
- On callback cancellation, providers must stop emitting deltas, return a
  non-retryable `model_cancelled` error, and emit `model.cancelled` when they
  can resolve invocation metadata.
- Support upstream cancellation where the provider transport permits it.
- Convert provider-specific stop reasons to {{PROJECT_NAME}} stop metadata.
- Bound memory usage for long streams.
- Surface partial output carefully when errors occur.

## 7. Error Mapping

Provider errors must become structured {{PROJECT_NAME}} errors.

Required categories:

- authentication failure
- authorization failure
- missing model
- invalid request
- rate limited
- timeout
- network failure
- provider unavailable
- malformed provider response
- cancelled

Errors must include actionable metadata but must not leak credentials, headers, or full sensitive request bodies.

The runtime must surface `requested_model`, `effective_provider`,
`effective_model`, and fallback state on model-backed message events whenever
the provider can resolve them. Provider failures should use stable error codes
and redacted messages; authentication or configuration failures must not fall
back silently unless the selected provider is explicitly fallback-capable, such
as `auto`.

## 8. Model Catalog

The daemon must support `models.list` for UI and CLI clients.

Catalog behavior:

- include configured providers and models
- identify the default model
- include per-agent model assignments
- preserve current configured values even if a model is temporarily missing
- make provider unavailability visible without deleting configuration

Per-agent model IDs should use `provider/model` where possible. Supported MVP
provider prefixes are `auto`, `ollama`, `openai`, `codex-cli`, and `echo`.
Plain model IDs are interpreted against the configured default provider.

## 9. Provider Conformance

Every provider must pass conformance tests before being marked supported.

Required conformance tests:

- streams deltas in order
- emits completed event
- maps authentication error
- maps rate limit error
- maps malformed response
- supports cancellation or reports unsupported clearly
- redacts credentials in logs
- exposes capability metadata
- handles provider timeout

Live provider tests must be opt-in and skipped by default in CI.

Current baseline support:

- Ollama streams native `/api/generate` NDJSON chunks through the shared
  callback interface.
- OpenAI streams Chat Completions server-sent events through the shared
  callback interface.
- Codex CLI remains callback-compatible through `codex exec` output, with
  stream granularity limited by the official CLI process output.

## 10. Custom HTTP Provider

The custom HTTP provider is for advanced users and integration testing.

Requirements:

- explicit endpoint configuration
- explicit auth header configuration through secret references
- strict response schema
- timeout
- cancellation if supported by transport
- no arbitrary code execution

Custom HTTP provider errors must use the same error mapping as built-in providers.

## 11. UI Requirements

HUD model UI must:

- list available models from the daemon
- show the default model
- support per-agent model selection
- preserve the selected value if absent from the current catalog
- send updates through `agent.model.set`
- update the central orb meta ring after daemon confirmation

The UI must not fetch model catalogs directly from vendors.

## 12. Testing Requirements

Required tests:

- config parsing for each provider
- missing secret handling
- `models.list` response shape
- default model selection
- per-agent model assignment
- mock streaming success
- cancellation
- provider error mapping
- redaction of provider keys
- HUD catalog mapping
