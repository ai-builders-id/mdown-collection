# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Tool Runtime Standard

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines how native {{PROJECT_NAME}} tools are registered, validated, executed, observed, and governed. Tools are a privileged runtime surface. They must be designed for safety, auditability, and predictable behavior.

## 2. Tool Registry

All tools must be registered in the daemon-owned tool registry before use.

Each tool must declare:

- stable name
- version or compatibility marker
- input schema
- output schema
- risk class
- workspace constraints
- timeout behavior
- cancellation support
- event fields emitted during execution

Initial tools:

- `file.read`
- `file.search`
- `file.patch`
- `shell.run`
- `git.status`
- `git.diff`
- `git.worktree.create`
- `git.worktree.remove`

Current implementation baseline:

- `file.read`, `file.search`, `git.status`, and `git.diff` are native
  safe-read tools.
- `shell.run` is an approval-gated native execution backend with explicit cwd,
  bounded redacted stdout/stderr, exit-code reporting, timeout failure, and
  process cleanup on timeout.
- `file.patch` is an approval-gated structured replace/write backend with
  workspace-relative path checks, replace-context validation,
  symlink/protected-path guards, and secret-like path rejection.
- `file.write`, `git.worktree.create`, and `git.worktree.remove` are classified
  and approval-gated placeholders.
- Unknown tool names are denied before execution.
- Approval-gated placeholders without native execution backends fail closed
  after approval resolution.
- Worker orchestration may emit planned worktree and artifact metadata without
  invoking `git.worktree.create`; that event metadata is intent, not filesystem
  mutation.
- Worker command execution baseline runs a bounded daemon-owned validation
  command inside {{PROJECT_NAME}}-owned worker worktrees and records result artifacts.
  Configurable worker command/test execution remains future work and must stay
  daemon-owned, policy-gated, and isolated to the worker worktree.

## 3. Naming

Tool names must be stable protocol identifiers.

Rules:

- Use dotted names: `domain.action`.
- Do not encode implementation language in the name.
- Do not rename a tool without a compatibility plan.
- Experimental tools must be clearly marked in capability metadata.

## 4. Schema Requirements

Tool inputs and outputs must be structured data.

Rules:

- Validate input before policy evaluation and execution.
- Reject unknown or incompatible fields when they affect safety.
- Return structured errors with codes, messages, and actionable metadata.
- Include normalized paths separately from user-supplied paths when path safety matters.
- Avoid ad hoc string parsing when a structured API is available.

## 5. Risk Classes

Every tool call must have a risk classification.

Example classes:

| Risk Class | Examples | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| safe-read | file reads inside workspace, git status | auto-allow |
| workspace-edit | patch inside workspace | policy decision |
| system-change | shell command or process execution | approval required |
| secret-access | environment or config secret access | approval required |
| outside-workspace | writing outside allowed roots | approval required |
| dangerous-delete | recursive delete, destructive cleanup | approval required |
| git-push-main | push to protected main branch | approval required |
| git-force-push | force push | approval required |
| sudo-system | sudo, package manager, service mutation | approval required |

Risk classification must be conservative. If classification is ambiguous, choose the higher-risk class.

## 6. Workspace Boundaries

Tools must enforce workspace constraints in the daemon.

Rules:

- Resolve and normalize paths before access.
- Reject path traversal outside allowed roots unless policy explicitly allows it.
- Symlinks must not bypass workspace boundaries.
- Resolve registered workspace IDs and active workspace grants before execution.
- Agent-scoped grants require matching `tool.call.agent_id`; global grants omit
  `agent_id`.
- Outside-workspace writes require approval.
- Reads that may expose secrets require policy review even if inside workspace.
- Temporary test directories must be isolated from user state.

## 7. Execution Lifecycle

Every tool call must emit lifecycle events:

```text
tool.requested
approval.requested, when required
approval.resolved, when required
tool.started
tool.output.delta
tool.completed
tool.failed
tool.cancelled
```

Events must include:

- `session_id`
- `agent_id`, when applicable
- `tool_call_id`
- tool name
- risk class
- started and completed timestamps
- cwd or workspace, when applicable

Output events must be bounded. Long stdout, stderr, diffs, and logs should be chunked, summarized, or routed to appropriate log storage.

Current protocol support includes `tool.requested`, `tool.started`,
`tool.completed`, `tool.failed`, `approval.requested`, and
`approval.resolved`. A typed `tool.cancelled` event is the target terminal event
for async tool cancellation, but it must not be treated as implemented until the
protocol crate and runtime emit it.

## 7.1 Approved Execution Revalidation

Approval authorizes a daemon attempt; it does not bypass policy or grant a
client permission to run the action.

Before an approved risky tool starts, `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` must revalidate:

- approval exists, is still pending at response time, and is not expired
- tool name still resolves to the same registered contract
- normalized input still matches the approved action summary
- workspace ID resolves to the same registered root
- active workspace grant still permits the required access
- target paths do not hit denied paths or symlink escapes
- secret access is explicitly allowed by policy and approval metadata
- linked session, AgentSession, and worker state still allow execution

If any revalidation fails, the tool must emit `tool.failed` and must not emit
`tool.started`.

## 8. Shell Tool

`shell.run` is high risk and must be policy-gated.

Requirements:

- explicit command and args representation where possible
- explicit cwd
- timeout
- cancellation
- stdout and stderr capture
- exit code capture
- environment filtering
- no implicit secret injection
- structured failure for timeout, spawn failure, and nonzero exit

Commands that mutate system state, use `sudo`, install packages, delete files, alter protected git refs, or access secrets must require approval.

Track D implementation must keep `shell.run` inside a registered workspace or
{{PROJECT_NAME}}-owned worker worktree. The target environment starts from a minimal
allowlist; provider keys, auth tokens, SSH agent details, and {{PROJECT_NAME}} secrets are
not passed unless a later explicit secret-access policy permits it.
Cancellation must stop the child process and clean up any process group or
temporary files where the platform supports it.

Current baseline note: approved `shell.run` can execute after approval and
daemon-side workspace/grant revalidation, captures bounded redacted output,
reports exit code, and kills the process group on timeout. Worker completion
also runs a fixed daemon-owned validation command inside the worker worktree and
records its report in artifacts. Minimal environment filtering, typed async
cancellation, and configurable worker command/test policy remain hardening
requirements.

## 9. File Tools

`file.read` and `file.search` should be safe by default only inside allowed workspaces and after secret policy checks.

The initial `file.read` and `file.search` implementation resolves paths with
canonical filesystem paths and rejects reads outside the request workspace.
Search skips unreadable files and large files, redacts result lines, and bounds
the returned match list.

`file.patch` requirements:

- patch must be previewable
- patch must apply only to intended files
- conflicts must be explicit
- writes must be atomic where practical
- generated patches must not overwrite unrelated edits
- outside-workspace writes require approval
- denied paths and symlink escapes must fail closed
- secret-bearing paths require explicit secret-access policy
- context mismatch or concurrent user edits must fail closed

Patch application must preserve user changes and should fail closed on mismatched context.

Worker patch application is not implicit. A worker may create `patch.diff` and
`summary.md` artifacts, but applying that patch to the parent workspace is a
separate `file.patch` or future patch-apply tool call with its own policy
decision and approval. `worker.completed` is never authorization to mutate the
parent checkout.

Current baseline note: approved `file.patch` supports structured `replace` and
`write` operations after approval, validates workspace-relative targets,
rejects protected metadata paths and secret-like paths, and fails closed when
replace context is missing or ambiguous. Atomic temp-file writes, full preview
UX, and broader concurrent-edit hardening remain required.

## 10. Git Tools

Git tools must prefer explicit commands or library calls with clear output.

Rules:

- `git.status` and `git.diff` are safe-read by default.
- The current native baseline runs `git.status` and `git.diff` under the daemon
  after workspace path normalization. `git.diff` uses `git diff --no-ext-diff
  --no-color --` with a workspace-relative pathspec guard and bounded,
  redacted output.
- Worktree creation must validate repository state.
- Worktree cleanup must avoid deleting paths not created by {{PROJECT_NAME}}.
- `git.worktree.create` must consume daemon worktree intent, not ad hoc client
  paths, and must emit a later event that moves the worktree state from
  `planned` to `active` only after successful creation.
- `git.worktree.remove` must require a {{PROJECT_NAME}}-owned worker/worktree record and
  preserve artifacts unless an explicit cleanup policy says otherwise.
- Terminal worker states such as `review_pending` and `cleanup_pending` are
  cleanup planning metadata, not deletion. Actual worktree removal must be a
  separate approval-gated flow.
- Push, force-push, rebase, reset, and branch deletion are not initial native tool actions unless policy and approval coverage exist.

## 11. Cancellation and Timeouts

All long-running tools must support cancellation or have a hard timeout.

Rules:

- Timeouts must produce `tool.failed` with timeout metadata.
- Cancellation must produce `tool.cancelled`.
- Child processes must be cleaned up when possible.
- The agent must receive a structured result after cancellation.

Current implementation declares timeout and cancellation metadata in the tool
registry, but approved mutating tools and async tool cancellation are not yet
implemented. Until they are, risky approved placeholders must continue to fail
closed.

## 12. Redaction and Logging

Tool logs must pass through redaction before persistence.

Never log:

- raw provider keys
- shell environment secrets
- unredacted auth headers
- private tokens in command output

When redaction changes output, preserve enough context for debugging without exposing the secret.

## 13. Testing Requirements

Required tests:

- registry rejects duplicate tool names
- schema validation accepts valid inputs and rejects unsafe ones
- risk classification for representative commands and paths
- workspace path normalization
- symlink boundary handling
- shell timeout and cancellation
- file patch conflict handling
- worker command/test execution stays inside the worker worktree
- worker result artifacts are redacted before persistence
- worker cleanup refuses paths without {{PROJECT_NAME}}-owned worktree metadata
- tool lifecycle event ordering
- redaction before persistence
- policy denial prevents execution
