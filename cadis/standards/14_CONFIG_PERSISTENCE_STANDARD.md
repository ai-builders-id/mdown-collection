# Config and Persistence Standard

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines {{PROJECT_NAME}} configuration, local state, persistence, migration, and redaction rules.

`{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` owns durable state. Clients may cache view state, but they are not authoritative.

## 2. {{PROJECT_NAME}} Home

Default home:

```text
~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/
```

Default layout:

```text
~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/
|-- config.toml
|-- profiles/
|-- global-cache/
|-- plugins/
|-- logs/
|-- run/
`-- VERSION
```

Rules:

- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}_HOME` may override the default home.
- Paths in config may use `~`, but internal code should normalize before use.
- Runtime-created files should use restrictive permissions where possible.
- Current code has a partial `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}` baseline, store-level `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/state`
  helpers, default profile-home initialization, and persistent workspace
  registry/grant files. Full profile management remains future work.
- Coding worktrees live under the project `.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/worktrees/` directory by
  default, not under profile state. Worker records and artifacts live under the
  profile home.

## 2.1 Profile, Agent, Workspace, and Worker State

Target profile home:

```text
~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/<profile>/
|-- profile.toml
|-- .env
|-- secrets/
|-- channels/
|-- agents/
|-- memory/
|-- skills/
|-- workspaces/
|-- workers/
|-- sessions/
|-- artifacts/
|-- checkpoints/
|-- eventlog/
|-- logs/
`-- locks/
```

Rules:

- `.env`, `secrets/`, channel tokens, and auth material must not be committed,
  logged, or copied into project `.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/`.
- Agent homes under `agents/<agent>/` store persona, instructions, memory,
  skills, and policy, but not canonical session transcripts.
- Workspace registries under `workspaces/` record project roots, aliases, and
  grants. The project root itself remains outside profile state.
- Worker state records live under `workers/`; coding source files live in
  project worktrees.
- Generated worker artifacts live under `artifacts/workers/<worker-id>/`.

Project-local {{PROJECT_NAME}} metadata:

```text
<project>/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/
|-- workspace.toml
|-- skills/
|-- artifacts/
|-- worktrees/
`-- media/
```

Project `.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/` metadata is untrusted until validated by the daemon and does
not grant access by itself.

## 3. Config Format

- User config is TOML.
- Default path is `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/config.toml`.
- Config examples must not contain raw secrets.
- Unknown fields should be rejected or warned consistently by config version policy.
- Environment variables may override selected fields documented in `docs/16_CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`.

Required config areas:

- daemon
- transport
- agents
- policy
- models
- Telegram
- HUD
- voice
- agent display names
- agent model selections
- profile and workspace defaults once profile/workspace management is
  implemented

## 4. Secret Configuration

- Provider keys are referenced through environment variable names such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Telegram token is referenced through `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
- Raw keys must not be written to config examples, logs, diagnostics, protocol events, or tests.
- Future keychain support must preserve the same no-log rule.
- Redaction applies before serialization for logs and diagnostic output.

## 5. Policy Configuration

Allowed policy values:

```text
allow
ask
deny
```

Rules:

- Destructive, external, privileged, or secret-reading actions default to conservative behavior.
- Invalid policy values fail config validation.
- Policy config changes must not bypass runtime classification.
- Reloaded policy must be applied atomically.

## 6. Durable UI Preferences

HUD and voice preferences are daemon-backed config/state, not browser-local authority.

Examples:

- HUD theme
- background opacity
- hotkey
- always-on-top
- chat thinking and fast preferences
- voice enabled state
- voice provider, ID, rate, pitch, volume, auto-speak, and maximum spoken characters
- agent display names
- per-agent model selections

Rules:

- Accepted changes emit `ui.preferences.updated`, `agent.renamed`, or model-related events.
- UI may cache preferences only for rendering.
- Rename and model selection must survive HUD restart.

## 7. Event Logs

- Event logs are JSONL.
- Session logs and worker logs are separate.
- Logs include event IDs and session IDs where applicable.
- Tool lifecycle logs include tool call IDs.
- Approval logs include approval IDs and final resolution.
- Logs must be redacted before write.
- Debug mode may increase detail but must still redact secrets.
- Profile-scoped workspace metadata lives under
  `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/<profile>/workspaces/` now. Event logs and richer
  session/worker recovery will move deeper into the profile home as those
  managers mature.

## 7.1 Workspace Grants and Denied Paths

File, shell, git, and worker tools must resolve a workspace grant before
execution. Grants bind profile, agent, workspace, canonical root, access level,
expiry, and source.

Minimum denied paths:

```text
~/.ssh
~/.aws
~/.gnupg
~/.config/gcloud
~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/*/.env
~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/*/secrets
~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/*/channels/*/tokens
/etc
/dev
/proc
/sys
```

Rules:

- Missing, expired, corrupt, or mismatched grants fail closed or request
  approval.
- Path checks must canonicalize, reject symlink escape, verify grant root, check
  denied paths, and then execute.
- Grants for `/`, `$HOME`, system roots, or credential directories are invalid
  unless a future admin mode defines a reviewed exception.
- Agent-scoped grants require matching `tool.call.agent_id`; grants without
  `agent_id` apply only to the default local runtime context.

## 7.2 Media Assets

Project-scoped {{PROJECT_NAME}} media lives under `<project>/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/media/`:

```text
input/
generated/
thumbnails/
manifests/
exports/
```

Rules:

- Manifests record task/session IDs, producing agent or worker, provider/model
  when known, license/source notes, and intended target use.
- Secrets, provider tokens, raw channel tokens, and raw session transcripts must
  not be stored in project media directories.
- Large generated media should be ignored by default unless the project opts
  into tracking it.

## 8. Atomic Writes

State files must be written atomically:

```text
write temporary file -> flush -> rename into place
```

Rules:

- Partial writes must not corrupt authoritative state.
- Recovery should ignore or quarantine incomplete temporary files.
- Append-only JSONL logs may use append semantics, but state snapshots require atomic replacement.
- Tests should cover interrupted or malformed state where practical.

## 9. Crash Recovery

{{PROJECT_NAME}} should persist enough metadata to recover or explain:

- incomplete sessions
- pending or resolved approvals
- worker records
- worktree paths
- recent daemon events
- config version

Rules:

- Recovery must fail closed for uncertain approval state.
- Recovered state should emit events or snapshots so clients can rebuild view state.
- Corrupt state must produce actionable diagnostics without leaking secrets.

## 10. Migrations

- Storage format changes require an ADR.
- Config and state files should carry a version once migrations begin.
- Migrations must be idempotent or detect already-migrated state.
- Backup or rollback strategy is required for destructive migrations.
- Migration logs must be redacted.

## 11. Validation

Config and persistence changes require tests for:

- TOML parsing
- defaults
- environment overrides
- invalid values
- redaction
- atomic writes
- JSONL append behavior
- approval persistence
- UI preference persistence when applicable
- workspace grant path enforcement
- denied-path checks
- profile/agent/workspace doctor checks as managers mature
