## 15.1 Next Multi-Agent Execution Tracks

- [x] Track A: daemon event bus, live session subscription, and non-blocking generation path.
- [x] Track A HUD acceptance: live session, route, agent status, delta, and
  completion frames render visible progress before model completion.
- [x] Track B: provider readiness, effective model metadata, selected-model routing, and provider streaming/cancellation contract.
- [x] Track C: `AgentSession`, agent-driven spawn, limits, and worker registry.
  Baselines landed: AgentSession state/events, explicit daemon-owned spawn,
  spawn limits, worker registry, worker tail, worker result collection,
  worker failed/cancelled events, daemon-owned worker validation command
  execution, and provider-stream cancellation on `session.cancel`. Remaining:
  implicit model-driven spawn, configurable worker command/test execution, and
  cleanup removal.
- [x] Track D: policy-backed tools and approval persistence.
- [x] Track D baseline: tool contract metadata, safe-read `file.read` and
  `file.search`, `git.status`, `git.diff`, workspace grants, approval
  summaries, approval persistence/recovery, and redaction boundaries.
- [x] Track D docs/protocol alignment: approved execution semantics,
  `shell.run` and `file.patch` boundaries, timeout/cancellation expectations,
  denied paths, secret fail-closed behavior, and worker handoff sequence.
- [x] Track D approved execution baseline: approved `shell.run` and structured
  `file.patch` execution after workspace/input revalidation.
- [x] Track D hardening: minimal shell environment allowlist, typed async tool
  cancellation, atomic patch writes, and broader concurrent-edit protection.
- [x] Track E: daemon-owned voice provider path, STT language setting, and voice doctor.
- [x] Track E baseline: daemon-visible voice status/doctor/preflight, separated
  STT language and TTS voice settings, TTS provider stubs, and speech policy
  blocking for code, diffs, logs, and long tool/test output.
- [x] Track F: durable metadata and restart recovery for sessions, agents, AgentSessions, workers, and approvals.
- [x] Track F store baseline: atomic JSON helpers and fail-safe metadata recovery.
- [x] Track F daemon baseline: session/agent metadata survives runtime restart and cancelled sessions are removed.
- [x] Track F daemon worker baseline: worker metadata survives runtime restart and stale running workers recover as failed.
- [x] Track F AgentSession baseline: per-route AgentSession metadata survives runtime restart, snapshots replay recovered records, and corrupt final JSON reports daemon diagnostics while partial temp files are ignored.
- [x] Track F approval baseline: pending approval metadata survives runtime
  restart, snapshots replay active pending approvals, and repeated responses
  fail closed.
- [x] Track G: {{PROJECT_NAME}}-native {{AVATAR_NAME}} avatar engine.
- [x] Track H: profile homes, agent homes, workspace registry, grants, and worker worktrees.
- [x] Track H baseline: default profile layout plus persistent workspace registry/grants.
- [x] Track I baseline: daemon worker execution setup creates git worktrees,
  persists project-local worktree metadata, and writes profile-scoped worker
  artifacts for review.
- [x] Track I event baseline: worker failed/cancelled events carry durable
  failure, cancellation, and cleanup-planning metadata without parent checkout
  patch application.
- [x] Track I command execution baseline: daemon-owned validation command runs
  in isolated worker worktrees, records result artifacts, and keeps parent
  checkout untouched.
- [x] Track I cleanup planning: `worker.cleanup` moves {{PROJECT_NAME}}-owned terminal
  worker worktree metadata to `cleanup_pending`, rejects unknown/missing/non-owned
  paths, and does not delete files.
- [x] Track P14 artifact view baseline: HUD code work panel renders worker
  status, artifact references, and log tail read-only.
- [x] Track P14 apply/cleanup actions: route apply/discard through daemon
  approvals instead of disabled placeholders.
