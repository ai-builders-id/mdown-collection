# Known Limitations

This document lists known limitations of C.A.D.I.S. v1.1.x.

## Platform

- **Windows and macOS support is new and less tested than Linux.** The daemon,
  CLI, and HUD build and pass CI on all three platforms, but Linux remains the
  primary development and runtime target. Edge cases on Windows and macOS may
  exist.
- **aarch64 Linux not natively tested.** aarch64 Linux binaries are
  cross-compiled but not natively tested in CI.
- **HUD macOS bundle fails on icon format.** The Tauri macOS `.dmg` bundle
  requires icon assets that are not yet generated. HUD works via
  `pnpm tauri:dev` on macOS.

## Networking

- **No remote relay.** The daemon communicates via local Unix socket (Linux /
  macOS) or local TCP (`127.0.0.1:7433` on Windows or via `--tcp-port`). There
  is no remote daemon access, multi-machine relay, or cloud orchestration.

## Voice

- **Voice remains early.** Edge TTS, OpenAI TTS, and System TTS can produce real
  audio output, but speech workflows are still less mature than text-only flows.
  Whisper transcription depends on a local `whisper-cli` binary.
- **TTS providers other than Edge, OpenAI, and System use stub implementations.**
  OpenAI TTS requires `{{PROJECT_NAME}}_OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `curl` to be
  available. System TTS uses `espeak` on Linux, `say` on macOS, and PowerShell
  `System.Speech` on Windows. OpenAI and System TTS fall back to stubs if their
  runtime prerequisites are not available.

## Clients

- **Telegram adapter has DaemonBridge but is not production-tested.** The
  adapter can poll Telegram, parse commands, and bridge to `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` via
  `DaemonBridge`, but the integration is early and not yet production-hardened.
- **No mobile client.** Android and iOS surfaces are future work.

## Runtime

- **Sequential tool calls per session.** Workers run concurrently via queue
  scheduling, but individual tool calls within a session execute sequentially.
  Async cancellation is not implemented yet; no cancellation propagation to
  running subprocesses.
- **{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-core lib.rs partial extraction done.** Major modules have been
  extracted into separate files, but some subsystems still carry significant
  inline logic. Further decomposition is ongoing.
- **Worker artifact view in HUD is read-only.** Apply/discard actions route
  through daemon approval but the full patch-apply flow needs more work.
- **`file.patch` lacks atomic writes.** Structured file patching works but does
  not yet use atomic temp-file writes or concurrent-edit protection.

## Configuration

- **Default `max_steps_per_session=8`.** Increase further for complex
  multi-step agent workflows that need more than 8 tool-call rounds.
