# Installation

## Status

Linux binary artifacts (`{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d`, `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}`) are available from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Growth-Circle/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/releases). Source
builds remain the primary path for the HUD. macOS is currently a Rust
source-validation baseline only, and Windows is limited to portable-crate
validation until runtime transport, shell, path, sandbox, HUD, and audio
adapters exist. See `docs/28_PLATFORM_BASELINE.md`.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** stable 1.75+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Git**
- **Linux desktop** (primary supported platform)

For the HUD (optional):
- **Node.js** 20+
- **pnpm** 10.x (`corepack enable`)
- **Tauri system dependencies** (Debian/Ubuntu):
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf
  ```

## From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Growth-Circle/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}.git
cd {{PROJECT_SLUG}}
cargo build --release
```

Core binaries:

```text
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d
```

The canonical desktop HUD lives in `apps/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud` and is built with pnpm and
Tauri. The Rust workspace also contains `crates/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud` (now
`{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud-legacy`), a deprecated native eframe prototype kept for reference.
All new HUD work should use the Tauri app.

The renderer-neutral {{AVATAR_NAME}} avatar state engine is a library crate,
`crates/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-avatar`; it is not an installed binary.

## First Run

Start the daemon:

```bash
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d --check
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d
```

In another terminal:

```bash
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}} status
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}} doctor
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}} models
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}} chat "hello"
```

Launch the canonical desktop HUD from source:

```bash
cd apps/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:dev
```

For a custom socket:

```bash
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d --socket /tmp/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud.sock --dev-echo
cd apps/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud
{{PROJECT_NAME}}_HUD_SOCKET=/tmp/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud.sock pnpm tauri:dev
```

For TCP transport (required on Windows, optional elsewhere):

```bash
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d --tcp-port 7433
cd apps/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud
{{PROJECT_NAME}}_TCP_PORT=7433 pnpm tauri:dev
```

To build the HUD frontend and native Tauri app locally:

```bash
cd apps/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud
pnpm build
pnpm tauri:build
```

The HUD is a protocol client of `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d`; it does not store credentials, execute
tools, own approval state, or hold durable runtime state. All authority lives in
the daemon.

## Transport

The daemon supports two transports:

- **Unix socket** (default on Linux/macOS): `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d.sock`
  or `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/run/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d.sock`.
- **TCP** (default on Windows, optional elsewhere): `127.0.0.1:7433`. Set
  `{{PROJECT_NAME}}_TCP_PORT` or use `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d --tcp-port 7433`.

The Tauri HUD, CLI, and legacy eframe HUD all support both transports. On
Windows, TCP is used automatically since Unix sockets are not available.

## Voice

Voice dependencies are optional unless you use HUD speech or mic input. The HUD
Voice settings include a local doctor that checks mic status, `whisper-cli`, the
Whisper model path, the Node helper used for Edge TTS, and local audio players.
The daemon exposes voice status, doctor, and preflight state, but the HUD/Tauri
bridge still owns local capture and playback mechanics.

## Model Providers

The default provider mode is `auto`: {{PROJECT_NAME}} tries Ollama at
`http://127.0.0.1:11434` and falls back to a local credential-free response if
Ollama is not ready. When Ollama is running, {{PROJECT_NAME}} streams native NDJSON deltas
from `/api/generate` into daemon `message.delta` events.

To use OpenAI, keep the API key in the daemon environment and set the provider
in `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/config.toml`:

```bash
export {{PROJECT_NAME}}_OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

```toml
[model]
provider = "openai"
openai_model = "gpt-4o"
openai_base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

Do not store the API key in `config.toml`. OpenAI responses stream through
Chat Completions server-sent events before the final `message.completed` event.

To use a ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription through Codex, authenticate the official
Codex CLI first and then select the adapter provider:

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
codex login
```

```toml
[model]
provider = "codex-cli"
```

{{PROJECT_NAME}} does not fork Codex CLI and does not read or copy `~/.codex/auth.json`.

## Local State

{{PROJECT_NAME}} stores local state in:

```text
~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}
```

Current desktop MVP contents:

```text
config.toml
logs/
sessions/
workers/
worktrees/
run/
tokens/
approvals/
```

The daemon socket defaults to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d.sock` when
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` exists, otherwise `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/run/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d.sock`.

Do not copy local `.env` files, Codex auth JSON, logs, sockets, crash dumps,
HAR traces, or Tauri bundle output into commits or release source archives.

## Optional Ollama Config

Create `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/config.toml`:

```toml
[model]
provider = "ollama"
ollama_model = "llama3.2"
ollama_endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:11434"
```

Then run:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
target/release/{{PROJECT_SLUG}} chat "hello"
```

## Known Limitations

- Linux is the only supported runtime/HUD target; binary artifacts are
  Linux-only.
- macOS has CI source validation but no packaged runtime or HUD support claim.
- Windows CI checks portable crates only; daemon, CLI transport, HUD, shell,
  and audio runtime paths are not supported yet. The Tauri HUD now supports TCP
  transport for future Windows use.
- Full async tool cancellation is not implemented yet.
- Telegram, mobile clients, and production daemon-owned voice output are not
  implemented yet.
- The native {{AVATAR_NAME}} avatar engine is not implemented yet; the crate provides the
  renderer-neutral state contract only.
- Concurrent-edit protection for shared state is not production-hardened yet.
- The Tauri HUD is source-built; packaged desktop HUD artifacts are not
  published yet. The npm package installs daemon + CLI only.

## Package Targets Later

- Linux tarball.
- Debian package.
- AppImage or similar desktop package.
- Homebrew formula for macOS after runtime adapters are validated.
- Windows installer after transport, shell, path, sandbox, HUD, and audio
  adapters are implemented and tested.
- Tauri HUD bundled in release artifacts after packaging pipeline is validated.
