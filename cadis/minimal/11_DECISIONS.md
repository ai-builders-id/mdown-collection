# Decision Log

This file records architecture and product decisions. It is intentionally lightweight until the project needs full ADR files.

## Accepted Decisions

### ADR-001: Start from a fresh monorepo

Status: Accepted.

Decision: {{PROJECT_NAME}} starts as a clean Rust monorepo, not as an {{LEGACY_UI}} backend or direct source import.

Reason:

- The core must be fast and deeply controllable.
- UI and backend coupling should be avoided.
- License and architecture risks are lower at the start.

Consequence:

- More implementation work upfront.
- Cleaner long-term boundaries.

### ADR-002: Use `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` as the core authority

Status: Accepted.

Decision: `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` owns sessions, events, agents, tools, policy, and persistence.

Reason:

- Multiple interfaces need one source of truth.
- Approvals must be central.
- Tool execution must not be duplicated across clients.

### ADR-003: Keep interfaces thin

Status: Accepted.

Decision: CLI, Telegram, HUD, voice, and Android are clients of the daemon protocol.

Reason:

- Prevents inconsistent behavior.
- Keeps security and policy centralized.
- Makes interface development parallel later.

### ADR-004: Rust-first core

Status: Accepted.

Decision: Core runtime components are implemented in Rust.

Reason:

- Performance.
- Strong typing.
- Good fit for daemon, CLI, protocol, and native tools.
- Avoids Node dependency in core.

### ADR-005: Apache-2.0 baseline license

Status: Accepted.

Decision: Use Apache-2.0 for original {{PROJECT_NAME}} baseline.

Reason:

- Permissive open-source license.
- Includes patent grant.
- Common for infrastructure projects.

Consequence:

- Imported source code must be license-compatible.
- Notices must be preserved.

### ADR-006: Runtime before HUD

Status: Accepted.

Decision: Build daemon, protocol, CLI, model stream, tools, policy, persistence, and agents before full HUD.

Reason:

- Prevents UI-first architecture.
- Makes all future interfaces easier.
- Keeps performance measurable.

### ADR-007: Native tools before MCP bridge

Status: Accepted.

Decision: Core tools are native Rust tools. MCP can be added later as an extension layer.

Reason:

- Native tools are easier to secure, test, and display in UI.
- Core tool behavior should not depend on external servers.

### ADR-008: Worktree isolation for coding workers

Status: Accepted.

Decision: Coding workers use git worktrees before patch application.

Reason:

- Prevents parallel edits from corrupting the main working tree.
- Makes patch review easier.
- Supports tester/reviewer workers.

### ADR-009: Logs are JSONL with redaction

Status: Accepted.

Decision: Event logs are append-only JSONL, with secrets redacted before write.

Reason:

- Easy to inspect.
- Good fit for event streams.
- Works before a database exists.

### ADR-010: Use {{UI_REFERENCE}} as the canonical HUD reference

Status: Accepted.

Decision: {{PROJECT_NAME}} desktop HUD adapts the {{UI_REFERENCE}} orbital HUD design, feature set, and interaction model as the canonical UI reference.

Reason:

- {{UI_REFERENCE}} already contains working UI behavior for config, voice, themes, model selection, agent rename, approvals, orbital agents, and desktop window controls.
- {{PROJECT_NAME}} needs those features without inheriting {{LEGACY_UI}} as the core runtime.
- A documented adaptation contract prevents the UI port from losing behavior.

Consequence:

- {{PROJECT_NAME}} must add protocol support for UI preferences, agent rename, per-agent model selection, voice preview, and window preferences.
- {{LEGACY_UI}} paths and localStorage ownership must be replaced by `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` protocol and `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}` state.
- UI toolkit remains a separate pending decision.

### ADR-011: Use Serde JSON for the initial protocol crate

Status: Accepted.

Decision: `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-protocol` uses `serde` and `serde_json` for the first typed request, response, and event contract.

Reason:

- {{PROJECT_NAME}} needs a stable JSON shape for CLI, daemon tests, HUD integration, Telegram, and future adapters.
- Serde is the Rust ecosystem standard for strongly typed serialization.
- JSON keeps early protocol examples easy to inspect and compare in tests.

Consequence:

- Protocol compatibility tests must cover serialized JSON shapes.
- Public protocol changes must update docs and tests together.
- Higher-performance encodings can be evaluated later without replacing the typed contract.

### ADR-012: Use egui for the first native HUD prototype

Status: Accepted.

Decision: The first {{PROJECT_NAME}} HUD prototype uses `eframe/egui` as a Rust-native desktop client.

Reason:

- {{PROJECT_NAME}} needs a window that can run immediately from the Rust workspace.
- The HUD must remain a protocol client and must not add Node.js to the daemon.
- `egui` supports custom-drawn orbital UI, low-radius panels, config controls, and a single Cargo-built binary.

Consequence:

- This is an operational prototype path, not a guarantee of final 100% {{UI_REFERENCE}} visual parity.
- Tauri + React and Dioxus remain valid future options if the project optimizes for exact {{UI_REFERENCE}} parity or Rust-first WebView UI.
- HUD state still belongs to `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d`; the UI only caches view state.

### ADR-013: Adopt {{AVATAR_NAME}} Arc as an optional HUD avatar

Status: Accepted.

Decision: The Tauri HUD can offer the contributed {{AVATAR_NAME}} Arc hologram avatar as
an optional center avatar alongside the default {{PROJECT_NAME}} orb.

Reason:

- The existing {{UI_REFERENCE}}-style orb remains the default visual and preserves HUD
  parity.
- {{AVATAR_NAME}} Arc gives the center avatar a more expressive state surface for
  listening, thinking, speaking, coding, and error states.
- The implementation stays isolated to `apps/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud` and is lazy-loaded so
  Three.js is not required by the daemon or the default orb path.
- Eye blink/gaze and mouth pulse are implemented as lightweight overlay
  animation, not as a full facial rig or lip-sync model.

License review:

- The sample came from the local `{{AVATAR_SLUG}}-contribute/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-arc-avatar-sample`
  contribution and does not include a separate LICENSE or NOTICE file.
- The new runtime dependencies used by the HUD avatar path, `three`,
  `@react-three/fiber`, and `@react-three/drei`, are MIT licensed.

Consequence:

- HUD avatar choice is stored as daemon-owned UI preference
  `hud.avatar_style`.
- Contributors should keep future avatar variants as optional HUD assets and
  avoid moving browser/WebGL dependencies into `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d`.

### ADR-014: Build {{AVATAR_NAME}} as a {{PROJECT_NAME}}-native avatar engine

Status: Accepted.

Decision: {{PROJECT_NAME}} will treat the current Three.js {{AVATAR_NAME}} Arc avatar as a prototype
and design the long-term {{AVATAR_NAME}} avatar as a native Rust rendering capability,
preferably a focused `wgpu` renderer rather than Bevy for the first production
path.

Reason:

- The avatar should remain local-first, fast, and daemon-driven without making
  browser WebGL the permanent animation boundary.
- {{AVATAR_NAME}}'s initial visual needs are narrow: portrait compositing, hologram
  shader, particles, reticles, eye/mouth overlays, body gestures, and
  state-driven transitions.
- A focused `wgpu` layer gives {{PROJECT_NAME}} direct control over frame budget,
  deterministic fixtures, fallback behavior, and dependency surface.
- Bevy is better reserved for a future decision if {{PROJECT_NAME}} needs a broader 3D
  scene engine, skeletal rigs, physics-like interaction, or a game-style ECS.

Consequence:

- `docs/26_AVATAR_ENGINE.md` is the canonical {{AVATAR_NAME}} native-engine plan.
- `crates/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-avatar` owns the renderer-independent state engine, body
  gesture state model, local-only face tracking privacy config, and
  dependency-free direct-wgpu contract.
- The Tauri/React/Three.js {{AVATAR_NAME}} Arc path remains a lazy-loaded HUD prototype
  until native parity is demonstrated.
- No heavy `wgpu` or Bevy dependency is wired into the state crate yet.
- Face tracking is optional, off by default, local-only, and requires explicit
  permission plus visible camera-active UI.
- Avatar state and preferences remain daemon-owned protocol state; renderer
  animation state remains disposable HUD state.

### ADR-015: Separate profile homes, agent homes, project workspaces, and worker worktrees

Status: Accepted.

Decision: {{PROJECT_NAME}} will use separate filesystem concepts for durable profile
state, persistent agent identity, project execution roots, and isolated coding
worker checkouts. The canonical design is `docs/27_WORKSPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Reason:

- Agent persona, memory, policy, sessions, and secrets must not be confused with
  the project cwd.
- Profiles isolate {{PROJECT_NAME}} state, but they are not filesystem sandboxes.
- Tools need explicit workspace grants so file, shell, git, and worker actions
  have enforceable roots and denied paths.
- Parallel coding workers need git worktrees to avoid colliding in the user's
  main checkout.
- Project-local `.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/` metadata is useful for worktrees, artifacts, skills,
  and media assets, but it must not grant access or store secrets by itself.

Consequence:

- Future workspace code must qualify vague `workspace` references as profile
  home, agent home, project workspace, worker worktree, sandbox root, or
  workspace grant.
- `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/<profile>/` becomes the target profile home layout.
- `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/<profile>/agents/<agent>/` becomes the target agent home
  layout.
- Coding worker worktrees default to `<project>/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/worktrees/<worker-id>/`.
- Generated or curated project media defaults to `<project>/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/media/` with
  manifests and without secrets or raw transcripts.
- Current code implements the first baseline for default profile initialization,
  persistent workspace registry/grants, broad-root rejection, safe-read grant
  enforcement, session-bound worker worktree creation, and metadata-only worker
  cleanup planning for {{PROJECT_NAME}}-owned worktrees. Agent homes, checkpoint rollback,
  worker file removal, and mutating-tool enforcement remain future work.

### ADR-016: Approved Track D tool execution is daemon-revalidated

Status: Accepted.

Decision: Approval is authorization to attempt a risky tool action, not a
client-side execution grant. After `approval.respond` approves a pending tool,
`{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` must revalidate the request before execution: approval state, expiry,
workspace grant, normalized input, denied paths, secret-access posture, current
session/worker state, and the registered tool contract.

Reason:

- Approvals can be resolved minutes after the original request and after
  workspace, policy, or session state changed.
- Clients must never turn approval into local shell, patch, or git execution.
- Worker patch application must preserve the parent checkout and remain
  reviewable.
- Secret access and denied paths need a final daemon-side fail-closed check,
  not only UI warning text.

Execution rules:

- `shell.run` executes only inside a registered workspace or {{PROJECT_NAME}}-owned worker
  worktree with an active `exec` or `admin` grant, filtered environment, bounded
  stdout/stderr, timeout, cancellation handling, and no implicit secret
  injection.
- `file.patch` applies only to daemon-normalized workspace-relative paths, must
  preview affected files before approval, must fail closed on context mismatch,
  symlink escape, denied path, or concurrent user edits, and must write
  atomically where practical.
- Secret access is denied by default. A tool that may read secrets must require
  explicit policy support and approval metadata before any secret-bearing input,
  environment value, file content, or output can cross the tool boundary.
- Approved worker patches flow through Track D as a new `file.patch` or future
  patch-apply tool call using the worker artifact as input; worker completion
  alone does not modify the parent workspace.
- Timeout emits a terminal failed result with timeout metadata. Cancellation
  emits the protocol terminal cancellation path once that event is implemented;
  until then, async tool cancellation remains pending and must not be marked
  complete.

Consequence:

- The current implementation may persist approvals and fail closed after
  approval for risky placeholders. That is correct until the `shell.run` and
  `file.patch` execution backends implement the revalidation and lifecycle
  rules above.
- Worker cleanup, patch apply, and command/test execution must stay separate
  approval-gated flows. The current cleanup slice records `cleanup_pending`
  metadata only; deleting worktree files remains future approved execution.
- Protocol and standards docs must continue to separate implemented safe-read
  tools from target approved execution semantics.

## Pending Decisions

### ADR-017: Defer Bevy renderer

Status: Accepted.

Decision: Defer the Bevy renderer path. The focused wgpu path meets current
avatar requirements. Bevy will be reconsidered if wgpu cannot handle particle
systems or complex scene graphs.

Reason:

- The {{AVATAR_NAME}} avatar's initial visual needs (portrait compositing, hologram
  shader, particles, reticles, eye/mouth overlays, body gestures) are narrow
  enough for a focused `wgpu` renderer.
- Bevy adds a large dependency surface and ECS overhead that is not justified
  until {{PROJECT_NAME}} needs skeletal rigs, physics, or a broader 3D scene engine.
- The `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-avatar` state crate already exposes a renderer-neutral
  `AvatarFrame` and `WgpuAvatarUniforms` contract that any future Bevy adapter
  can consume without changing the state engine.

Consequence:

- `BevyRendererStatus::Deferred` remains the default in `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-avatar`.
- The `bevy-renderer` Cargo feature is reserved but empty.
- If particle systems or scene complexity outgrow the focused wgpu path, this
  decision should be revisited with a concrete Bevy spike.

### ADR-P001: First model provider

Options:

- OpenAI first.
- Ollama first.
- Custom HTTP first.

Current recommendation:

- Implement the trait so OpenAI and Ollama are both natural, then choose one for the first working path based on available keys and local setup.

### ADR-P002: Initial local transport

Options:

- Unix socket.
- WebSocket.
- Stdio.
- Unix socket plus stdio test mode.

Current recommendation:

- Unix socket for Linux runtime, stdio mode for tests.

### ADR-P003: GUI framework

Options:

- Dioxus Desktop.
- Tauri + React.
- Slint.

Current recommendation:

- Use the accepted `egui` prototype for the first runnable desktop HUD. If fastest 100% {{UI_REFERENCE}} visual parity is required later, use Tauri + React for the HUD client while keeping `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` as the core. If Rust-first WebView UI consistency becomes more important, evaluate Dioxus.

### ADR-P004: TTS provider

Options:

- Rust Edge TTS provider.
- OS native speech.
- Piper offline.
- Node compatibility wrapper.

Current recommendation:

- Rust TTS trait first, provider stub, then Edge TTS or OS-native provider. Node wrapper stays optional compatibility only.

### ADR-P005: Codex-derived capability path

Options:

- Direct fork.
- Extract compatible internals.
- Reimplement compatible behavior.
- Adapter to installed Codex.

Current recommendation:

- Do not import or fork Codex CLI code during v0.1.
- Use an optional adapter to the installed official Codex CLI for ChatGPT-plan
  auth experiments.
- Keep `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` as the authority boundary; the adapter must not read or persist
  `~/.codex/auth.json`.
- Revisit direct integration only after daemon, protocol, policy, and tool
  runtime are stable.

### ADR-P006: {{UI_REFERENCE}}-Parity HUD App

Decision:

- Add `apps/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud` as the production-oriented Tauri + React desktop HUD.
- Keep `crates/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud` as the lightweight Rust prototype while the richer HUD
  uses the existing {{UI_REFERENCE}} visual language.
- The Tauri HUD is a protocol client only. It talks to `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` through the
  `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}_request` command and does not own credentials, sessions, approvals, or
  model provider state.

Rationale:

- The user already has a working {{UI_REFERENCE}} visual design and wants {{PROJECT_NAME}} to use
  that interaction model on desktop.
- `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` remains the authority boundary, so ChatGPT Plus/Pro access continues
  through the official Codex CLI adapter instead of importing or reading Codex
  credentials from the HUD.

Consequences:

- Frontend dependencies are isolated under `apps/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud`.
- Generated frontend output, `node_modules`, Tauri build output, local sockets,
  logs, and credential-like files stay ignored.
- UI preference changes are sent through `ui.preferences.set`; agent rename and
  model selection are confirmed by daemon events.

### ADR-P007: {{AVATAR_NAME}} Memory Architecture

Options:

- Simple session summaries only.
- File-backed memory without indexing.
- SQLite/FTS memory with a provenance ledger.
- External memory provider as the primary store.

Current recommendation:

- Treat {{AVATAR_NAME}}'s memory concept in `docs/25_MEMORY_CONCEPT.md` as the future
  {{PROJECT_NAME}} memory direction.
- Keep memory daemon-owned: `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` controls ACL, retrieval, ranking,
  promotion, persistence, and context compilation.
- Start with Markdown plus JSONL ledger plus SQLite metadata/FTS before adding
  vector retrieval or external providers.
- Keep external providers optional and additive; local memory remains the source
  of truth.
- Keep complex memory outside v0.1 unless this pending decision becomes accepted.

## Decision Rules

Require a new decision record when a change:

- changes daemon authority boundaries
- changes protocol compatibility
- adds risky tool behavior
- changes approval semantics
- imports third-party source code
- changes license
- moves core logic into an adapter
- changes storage format
