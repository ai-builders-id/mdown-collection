# Architecture Standard

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines the architectural rules for {{PROJECT_NAME}}.

{{PROJECT_NAME}} is daemon-first. `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` is the authority for sessions, agents, tools, policy, approvals, event routing, persistence, and model interaction. Every user interface is a client.

## 2. Core Rule

All operational behavior must pass through the daemon protocol.

Adapters may:

- render state
- collect user input
- submit protocol requests
- subscribe to events
- display approval prompts
- cache local view state for rendering

Adapters must not:

- execute tools directly
- own approval state
- mutate agent runtime state outside the daemon
- persist authoritative session or agent state in browser storage
- bypass policy for convenience
- implement core orchestration logic

## 3. Runtime Boundary

Core components:

- daemon process
- local protocol
- event bus
- session registry
- agent runtime
- worker scheduler
- model provider abstraction
- native tool runtime
- policy and approval engine
- persistence and redaction layer

Adapter components:

- CLI
- HUD
- code work window
- Telegram adapter
- voice client
- future Android remote
- optional MCP bridge

The optional MCP bridge is an extension path, not the core tool runtime.

## 4. Request Flow

The required fast path is:

```text
client request -> local protocol -> daemon session -> event bus -> model/tool stream
```

Rules:

- A client request must identify protocol version and request ID.
- The daemon accepts, rejects, or routes the request.
- State changes are emitted as events.
- Durable events are written through the store after redaction.
- Clients update from daemon events, not from optimistic local authority.

## 5. Tool and Approval Flow

Tool execution must follow this sequence:

```text
tool request -> policy classification -> approval if required -> execution -> lifecycle events -> redacted persistence
```

Rules:

- Model-generated tool calls are untrusted input.
- Policy classifies before execution.
- Denied, expired, corrupted, or missing approval state fails closed.
- Approval state is centralized and first valid response wins.
- Tool lifecycle events include tool call ID and session ID when applicable.

## 6. Worker Isolation

Parallel coding agents must not edit the same target working directory directly.

Default workflow:

```text
task -> worker -> {{PROJECT_NAME}}-controlled git worktree -> edit/test/diff -> review -> user approval -> apply
```

Rules:

- Worktrees default to project-local {{PROJECT_NAME}} metadata,
  `<project>/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/worktrees/<worker-id>`, unless policy explicitly configures
  another {{PROJECT_NAME}}-controlled root.
- Worker output streams through daemon events.
- Patch application to a target workspace is policy-gated.
- Cleanup is explicit or governed by policy.
- The main session event loop must remain responsive while workers run.

## 6.1 Workspace Architecture

{{PROJECT_NAME}} uses distinct filesystem concepts:

- Profile home: profile-scoped {{PROJECT_NAME}} state such as config, channels, agents,
  memory, sessions, workers, artifacts, logs, and locks.
- Agent home: one persistent agent's identity, instructions, memory, skills,
  and policy.
- Project workspace: a registered user project root available to tools only
  through a workspace grant.
- Worker worktree: an isolated git checkout for one coding worker/task.

Rules:

- Agent home must not be treated as project cwd.
- Profile home must not be treated as a sandbox.
- Project `.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/` metadata must not contain secrets and must not grant access
  without daemon-owned workspace grants.
- File, shell, git, and worker tools must resolve grants before execution.
- Coding workers default to `<project>/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/worktrees/<worker-id>/`.
- Project media assets generated or curated by {{PROJECT_NAME}} default to
  `<project>/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/media/` with manifests and without secrets or raw
  transcripts.

## 7. UI Architecture

The HUD and code work window communicate only through the daemon protocol.

Rules:

- HUD state is derived from events and daemon-backed preferences.
- Durable HUD preferences live in daemon config/state.
- Approval cards remain visible until `approval.resolved`.
- Agent rename and per-agent model selection must persist through daemon state.
- Voice playback follows content-kind routing and must not speak code, diffs, terminal logs, or secrets.

## 8. Transport Architecture

Initial transport is local-only:

- Unix domain socket for Linux MVP.
- Stdio for tests and scripted clients.
- WebSocket later for HUD and remote relay only after protocol behavior is stable.
- Windows and macOS runtime transport support requires explicit adapters and
  validation; current platform status is documented in
  `docs/28_PLATFORM_BASELINE.md`.

Rules:

- Protocol version is mandatory.
- Incompatible clients are rejected.
- Local transport must not be exposed remotely by default.
- Reconnect behavior must recover recent state where available.

## 9. Persistence Architecture

Default {{PROJECT_NAME}} home:

```text
~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/
|-- config.toml
|-- profiles/
|-- global-cache/
|-- plugins/
|-- logs/
|-- run/
`-- VERSION
```

Rules:

- State writes are atomic.
- Event logs are JSONL.
- Session and worker logs are separate.
- Secrets are redacted before persistence.
- Target profile-scoped state lives under `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/profiles/<profile>/`.
- Current implementation may still use transitional `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/state` helpers
  until profile homes are implemented.
- Crash recovery uses persisted metadata where possible.

## 10. Architecture Changes

An ADR in `docs/11_DECISIONS.md` is required for:

- changing the daemon-first authority model
- changing local transport strategy
- changing protocol compatibility rules
- changing storage formats
- changing tool execution or policy flow
- adding direct tool execution to any adapter
- changing the UI framework
- importing substantial source from another project

## 11. Review Questions

Every architecture review should ask:

- Does this keep `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` authoritative?
- Does every risky operation pass through policy?
- Can clients reconstruct state from events and snapshots?
- Are secrets redacted before leaving their trust boundary?
- Can the main daemon loop stay responsive?
- Is this behavior testable without a GUI?
