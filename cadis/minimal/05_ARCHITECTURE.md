# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Architecture

## 1. Architecture Summary

{{PROJECT_NAME}} uses a daemon-first architecture. `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` owns sessions, agents, tools, policy, event routing, persistence, and model interaction. All user interfaces are clients.

## 3. Runtime Boundary

### Core

- daemon
- local protocol
- event bus
- sessions
- model provider abstraction
- native tools
- policy engine
- persistence
- agent scheduler

### Adapters

- CLI
- Telegram
- HUD
- code work window
- voice
- optional {{AVATAR_NAME}} avatar renderer
- model provider implementations
- optional MCP bridge later

Adapters may format, display, and relay events. They must not own business logic for tools, policy, or agent orchestration.

The {{AVATAR_NAME}} avatar state engine is a library boundary, not runtime authority.
`crates/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-avatar` converts daemon-derived HUD state into renderable
`AvatarFrame` values, including body gesture state, face pose, material hints,
privacy metadata, and direct-wgpu uniform data. A concrete `wgpu` renderer may
consume that contract later; Bevy remains optional and deferred. The HUD must
fall back to the default {{PROJECT_NAME}} orb if native avatar rendering fails.

## 4. Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant C as {{PROJECT_SLUG}} CLI
  participant D as {{PROJECT_SLUG}}d
  participant B as Event Bus
  participant M as Model Provider
  participant L as Log Store

  U->>C: {{PROJECT_SLUG}} chat "hello"
  C->>D: CreateSession request
  D->>B: SessionStarted
  B->>C: SessionStarted
  B->>L: append event
  D->>B: OrchestratorRoute / AgentStatusChanged
  D->>M: stream response
  M-->>D: delta
  D->>B: MessageDelta
  B->>C: MessageDelta
  B->>L: append event
  M-->>D: complete
  D->>B: MessageCompleted
```

`{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` prepares message routing and session state under the runtime mutex, but
model provider generation runs outside that mutex. The daemon reacquires the
runtime only to create authoritative event envelopes, so unrelated status and
agent-list requests can proceed while a slow provider is generating.

## 5. Approval Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as Agent
  participant P as Policy Engine
  participant B as Event Bus
  participant CLI as CLI
  participant TG as Telegram
  participant T as Tool Runtime

  A->>P: request shell.run
  P->>B: ApprovalRequested
  B->>CLI: approval prompt
  B->>TG: approval message
  TG->>P: approve approval_id
  P->>B: ApprovalResolved approved
  P->>T: execute tool
  T->>B: ToolStarted
  T->>B: ToolCompleted
```

Rules:

- Approval request is created before execution.
- Each approval has one authoritative state.
- First valid response wins.
- Denied or expired approvals do not execute.
- All clients receive the final state.

## 6. Coding Work Flow

```text
user task
  -> session created
  -> task classified as code-heavy
  -> code work context created
  -> worker created
  -> worker event emits planned worktree and artifact locations
  -> git worktree created
  -> coding agent edits in worktree
  -> tester runs tests
  -> reviewer checks diff
  -> code window shows patch and logs
  -> user approves apply
  -> patch applied to target workspace
```

The main conversation remains readable. Diffs, logs, and test output go to the code work window.

## 7. Event Model

Important event families:

```text
# Session
session.started
session.completed
message.delta
message.completed

# Agent
agent.spawned
agent.status.changed
agent.completed
agent.session.started
agent.session.completed
agent.session.failed
agent.session.cancelled

# Worker
worker.started
worker.log.delta
worker.completed
worker.cancelled
worker.cleanup.requested

# Tool & Approval
tool.requested
tool.started
tool.completed
tool.failed
approval.requested
approval.resolved
patch.created
test.result

# Voice
voice.started
voice.completed
voice.preview.started
voice.preview.completed
voice.preview.failed
voice.status.updated
voice.doctor.response
voice.preflight.response

# Daemon
daemon.started
daemon.stopping
daemon.error

# Routing & UI
orchestrator.route
ui.preferences.updated
models.list.response
```

All events must be serializable and durable enough for logs.

Worker lifecycle events carry intent before side effects. The baseline daemon may
emit `worktree.state = planned` with branch and path metadata without creating a
git worktree. A later worker runtime is responsible for turning that intent into
`git.worktree.create` tool execution after workspace grants, policy, and
approval checks have passed.

## 8. Content Routing

Every output should declare a content kind:

```text
chat
summary
code
diff
terminal_log
test_result
approval
error
```

Routing rules:

| Content kind | HUD | CLI | Telegram | Voice | Code Window |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| chat | Show | Show | Optional | Speak if enabled | No |
| summary | Show | Show | Push | Speak if enabled | Optional |
| code | Link | Link | Summary | Short summary only | Show |
| diff | Link | Link | Summary | No | Show |
| terminal_log | Link | Tail | Summary | No | Show |
| test_result | Show summary | Show summary | Push summary | Short summary | Show |
| approval | Card | Prompt | Buttons | Risk summary | Optional |
| error | Show | Show | Push | Actionable summary | Optional |

## 9. Agent Tree

Agents are represented as nodes:

```text
main
|-- coder
|   |-- tester
|   `-- reviewer
`-- researcher
```

Default limits:

```toml
[agents]
max_depth = 2
max_children_per_agent = 4
max_global_agents = 32
default_timeout_sec = 900
allow_recursive_spawn = true
```

The desktop MVP now wraps each routed task in an in-memory daemon-owned
`AgentSession`. The record carries the route ID, task summary, result/error
summary, timeout deadline, step budget, cancellation timestamp, target agent,
and parent agent. Clients observe it through `agent.session.started`,
`agent.session.updated`, and terminal `agent.session.completed`,
`agent.session.failed`, or `agent.session.cancelled` events. AgentSession
metadata is also written atomically under `~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/state/agent-sessions/` and
loaded on daemon start so `events.snapshot` can replay recovered records.
Provider/tool-loop execution and implicit model-driven spawning remain later
work.

## 10. Model Provider Layer

Provider interface responsibilities:

- stream response events
- expose capabilities
- map provider errors to {{PROJECT_NAME}} errors
- support cancellation
- support tool call metadata when available

Initial providers:

- OpenAI
- Ollama
- Anthropic
- Gemini
- OpenRouter
- LM Studio
- custom HTTP

The provider contract should be proven with one cloud provider and one local provider before broad expansion.

## 11. Tool Runtime

Tools are native Rust components first.

Each tool declares:

- name
- description
- input schema
- output schema
- risk class
- workspace behavior
- timeout behavior
- cancellation behavior

MCP can be added later as an extension bridge, not as the default mechanism for core tools.

## 12. Persistence Architecture

```text
~/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/
|-- config.toml
|-- profiles/
|   `-- default/
|       |-- profile.toml
|       |-- agents/
|       |-- workspaces/
|       |   |-- registry.toml
|       |   `-- grants.jsonl
|       |-- sessions/
|       |-- workers/
|       |-- artifacts/
|       |-- checkpoints/
|       `-- logs/
|-- logs/
|-- run/
`-- state/
    |-- approvals/
    |-- sessions/
    |-- agents/
    `-- workers/
```

The store must protect against partial writes and log secret leakage. Current
runtime state still uses the legacy `state/*` helpers for early session, worker,
and approval recovery, while workspace registry/grants live in the default
profile. Project-local worktrees default to `<project>/.{{PROJECT_SLUG}}/worktrees/` once
worker checkout creation is implemented.

Future memory architecture is tracked in `25_MEMORY_CONCEPT.md`. That concept
extends persistence with daemon-owned memory capsules, scoped Markdown memory,
SQLite metadata/FTS, append-only memory ledger events, ACL enforcement, and
optional local vector retrieval. It remains future work until accepted by a
decision record and protocol update.

## 13. Security Architecture

Security-sensitive behavior is centralized:

- policy engine classifies risk
- approval engine resolves permission
- tool runtime enforces policy result
- store redacts logs
- event bus distributes audit state

No adapter may bypass policy by executing tools directly.

## 14. Platform Baseline And Future Cross-Platform Notes

Linux starts with Unix sockets, POSIX shell behavior, and Linux-friendly desktop
assumptions. It remains the primary runtime and HUD target for the current MVP.
The current validation matrix is documented in `docs/28_PLATFORM_BASELINE.md`.

macOS is a Rust source-validation baseline only. Windows is a portable-crate
validation baseline only. Runtime support on either platform needs separate
adapters for:

- shell execution
- path normalization
- sandboxing
- audio output
- local socket transport
- notifications

Android starts as a remote controller only.

## 15. Output Filter Pipeline

Tool outputs are compressed before returning to the agent context to reduce
token consumption. Inspired by [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) (Rust
Token Killer), the `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-output-filter` crate applies command-specific
parsers and a generic filter pipeline to achieve 60-90% token reduction.

Pipeline stages:
1. Strip ANSI escape codes
2. Command-specific parser (cargo test, cargo build, git status, git diff, etc.)
3. Line deduplication with counts
4. Truncation with head/tail preservation
5. Error-line preservation (errors are never filtered)

Stage 6: Semantic-boundary truncation — breaks at headings, code fences, and function boundaries instead of raw byte limits (inspired by [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd))

The filter runs synchronously after tool execution and before the result is
returned to the agent. Raw output is preserved in the event log for debugging.

### Search Index

The `file.search` tool uses a trigram-based search index for large workspaces
(>100 files). The index pre-filters candidate files before line-by-line grep,
reducing search time significantly. Inspired by
[QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd)'s FTS5 approach but implemented without
external database dependencies.

## 16. Stable Error Codes

All daemon error codes use `snake_case`. No hyphens, no camelCase. Every
`ErrorPayload`, `RuntimeError`, and `tool_error()` in `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-core` follows this
convention.
