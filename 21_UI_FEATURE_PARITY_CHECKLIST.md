# UI Feature Parity Checklist

## 1. Goal

This checklist tracks {{UI_REFERENCE}}-to-{{PROJECT_NAME}} UI parity. A checked item means the {{PROJECT_NAME}} implementation preserves the user-visible behavior and maps it to {{PROJECT_NAME}} daemon protocol/state.

## 2. Source Audit

- [x] Audit `{{UI_REFERENCE_SLUG}}-hud` app composition.
- [x] Audit config/settings window.
- [x] Audit agent rename flow.
- [x] Audit voice picker and TTS/STT behavior.
- [x] Audit theme system.
- [x] Audit orbital HUD layout.
- [x] Audit gateway topics and outgoing commands.
- [x] Audit approval card behavior.
- [x] Audit wizard and desktop window behavior.
- [x] Audit {{UI_REFERENCE}} design specs.

## 3. Architecture Decisions

- [x] Decide HUD toolkit: Tauri + React for fastest parity or Dioxus for Rust-first UI.
- [x] Record toolkit decision in `docs/11_DECISIONS.md`.
- [x] Define `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-hud.v1` protocol subset or reuse {{PROJECT_NAME}} protocol directly.
- [x] Decide voice ownership: daemon owns status, doctor, preview protocol,
  stop protocol, and speech policy; HUD remains the local capture/playback
  bridge where desktop APIs require it.
- [x] Decide how first-run wizard writes config.
