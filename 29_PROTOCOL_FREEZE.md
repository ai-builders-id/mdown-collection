# Protocol Freeze — v1.0 Stable Subset

This document defines the stable protocol surface for C.A.D.I.S. protocol
version `0.2`. Types listed here will not receive breaking changes in any
v1.x release without a major version bump.

## Protocol version

Current: **`0.2`** (`CURRENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION`).

## Transport format

NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON) over a Unix domain socket. Each message is
exactly one JSON object per line. Clients send `RequestEnvelope` objects; the
daemon replies with `ServerFrame` objects.

## ServerFrame envelope

Every line sent by `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d` is a `ServerFrame`, tagged by `frame`:

| Frame        | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `response`   | Immediate `ResponseEnvelope` for a client request |
| `event`      | Asynchronous `EventEnvelope` from the daemon      |

```json
{ "frame": "response", "payload": { "protocol_version": "0.2", "request_id": "…", "type": "…", "payload": {…} } }
{ "frame": "event",    "payload": { "protocol_version": "0.2", "event_id": "…", "timestamp": "…", "source": "{{PROJECT_SLUG}}d", "type": "…", "payload": {…} } }
```

| Wire type                  | Variant          | Description                                              |
|----------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| `daemon.status.response`   | DaemonStatus     | Current daemon health and runtime status                 |
| `request.rejected`         | RequestRejected  | Request was rejected before execution                    |

## Stability guarantees

The types, wire names, and payload shapes listed above are frozen for the v1.x
release line. Specifically:

- No variant will be removed or renamed.
- No required payload field will be removed or change type.
- New optional fields may be added to existing payloads.
- New variants may be added to `ClientRequest`, `{{PROJECT_NAME}}Event`, and `DaemonResponse`.
- Clients must tolerate unknown event types and unknown fields.

A breaking change to any frozen type requires a major protocol version bump.

## What is NOT frozen

The following are explicitly outside the stability contract and may change
between any releases:

- Internal daemon behavior and implementation details
- Model provider selection, fallback logic, and provider adapters
- Tool execution internals, shell environment filtering, and sandbox policy
- UI rendering, HUD layout, and client-side presentation
- JSONL persistence format and redaction boundaries
- Worker orchestration scheduling and concurrency limits
- Avatar engine internals and renderer adapters
- Configuration file schema beyond what the protocol exposes
